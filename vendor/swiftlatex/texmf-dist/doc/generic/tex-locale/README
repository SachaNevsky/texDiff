LaTeX usage: \usepackage{tex-locale}

TeX usage: \input tex-locale

LaTeX code is in tex-locale.sty. Generic TeX code is in tex-locale.tex.

Requirements: tracklang and texosquery. Note that texosquery
requires the Java Runtime Environment. See the texosquery
documentation for setup instructions. If you can't enable piped
shell escape, see the tex-locale documentation for an alternative
method.

This package uses both tracklang and texosquery to look up the
locale information from the operating system and provide commands
that can access locale-dependent information, such as the currency
symbol and decimal separator.

The LaTeX package tex-locale.sty can additionally load babel or
polyglossia with the locale's language setting, as well as various other
packages such as fontspec (XeLaTeX/LuaLaTeX) or fontenc + inputenc.
