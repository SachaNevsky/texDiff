This package aims to propose a model of the fidget spinner gadget. 
It exists under different forms  with 2, 3 poles and even more. 
We chosed the most popular model: the triple Fidget Spinner.
You can run the PSTricks related documents with xelatex. If
you use an background image or an animation then you have to 
choose the latex->dvips->ps2pdf sequence, which is, of course,
only one click in many Editors.
