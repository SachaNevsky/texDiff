An eps image can only be used if it uses only the basic
function moveto, lineto, curveto, rlineto, and closepath.

The script make.sh will create an eps from an existing
one with only such functions. This is also important for
math expressions which cannot be shown on a sphere,
PostScript hasn't such symbols in its fonts. An eps
image must be created before.
