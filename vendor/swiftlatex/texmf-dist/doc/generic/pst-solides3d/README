If you are unable to install this package by your package manager
of the TeX distribution, save the files

pst-solides3d.sty
pst-solides3d.tex
pst-solides3d.pro
pst-implicitsurface.pro

in any place, where latex or any other TeX program will find it.
If you like to get the documentation file in another format run 

latex pst-solides3d-doc.tex
latex pst-solides3d-doc.tex
dvips pst-solides3d-doc.dvi
ps2pdf pst-solides3d-doc.ps

to get a Pdf file. But pay attention, that the pst-solides3d
files are saved in the above mentioned way, before you run
latex on the documentation file.

The intermediate DVI file works only with viewers which can 
interprete the embedded PostScript code, like the one from KDE.
