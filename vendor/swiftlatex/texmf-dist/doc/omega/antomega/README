ANTOMEGA language support package
version 0.8 (May 7, 2005)

Copyright (C) 2001--2005 Alexej Kryukov <basileia@yandex.ru>.

ANTOMEGA is a language support package for Omega/Lambda, based on the
original omega.sty file. However, it provides some new functionality,
including support for additional languages. ANTOMEGA supports standard
babel-like commands for switching languages, so that you can easily move
your documents from LaTeX to Lambda.

See the documentation for installation instructions, FAQ, TODO and history.

Happy TeXing!
