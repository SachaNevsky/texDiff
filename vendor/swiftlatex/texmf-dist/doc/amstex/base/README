README for AMS-TeX version 2.2                             2019/01/18

This is the final archival distribution of AMS-TeX.  AMS-TeX is no
longer supported by the AMS, nor is it used by the AMS publishing
program.  The AMS does not recommend creating any new documents using
AMS-TeX; this distribution will be left on CTAN to facilitate
processing of legacy documents and as a historical record of a
pioneering TeX macro collection that played a key role in popularizing
TeX and revolutionizing mathematics publishing.

In addition to the "User's Guide to AMS-TeX" (doc/amsguide.pdf), the
AMS is also making the full text of the most recent reprint of the
second edition of "The Joy of TeX" by Michael Spivak available for the
first time, as a pdf file.  "Joy" can be found on CTAN:
    http://mirrors.ctan.org/info/amstex-joy/joyt2.pdf

The best way to install AMS-TeX is via the package manager for your
TeX distribution.  If that is not an option, instructions for manual
installation are provided.

The following documentation files will be useful in installing and using
AMS-TeX.

amstinst.tex - Installation instructions, comprising Appendices B and C
amstinst.pdf   of amsguide, provided as both TeX source and ready-to-print
               PDF.
