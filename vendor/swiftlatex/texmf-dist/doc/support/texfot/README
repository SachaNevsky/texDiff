texfot is a Perl script to filter the online output from a TeX run,
attempting to show only those messages which (probably) deserve some
attention in the source.  The TeX invocation itself need not change.

The PDF file is made from the POD documentation in the Perl source:
  pod2man texfot.pl | groff -man -t -rS11 | ps2pdf - texfot.pdf

The -t preprocesses with (g)tbl, which pod2man output might need.
The -rS11 switches to 11pt font size.
Supposedly it is possible to add options to either groff or ps2pdf
(aka ghostscript) to force A4 page output, but nothing worked for me.
