                (C) Uwe Lueck 2012/03/16


`typeoutfileinfo.sh' is a minimalist shell script for Unix-like
systems, displaying the info content in the \ProvidesFile, 
\ProvidesPackage, or \ProvidesClass command of a LaTeX source 
file on screen. This requires the `readprov' package.
See the file `typeoutfileinfo.sh' for details.
