CLOJURE PAMPHLET SYSTEM
===========

The clojure pamphlet system is a system based on the clojure literate
system. In the clojure's pamphlet system you have your main LaTeX
file, which can be compiled regularly. This file contains
documentation and source code (just like in other forms of literate
programming). This code snippets are wrapped in the 'chunk'
environment, hence they can be recognized by the tangler in order to
extract them. Chunks can be included inside each other by the
'getchunk' command (which will be typesetted acordingly). Finally, you
run your LaTeX file through the tangler and get your desired chunk of
code.

See the INSTALL file for detailed information about how to configure
and install the tangler.
 This tangler is a program that takes a pamphlet latex file (A simple
latex file with special commands in it, see the latex clojure-pamphlet
package manual page) and a code section and outputs the specified code
section adding the chunks that are needed (and can be in any other
part of the document).
