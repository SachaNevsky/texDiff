		  Boris Veytsman & Leila Akhmadeeva
		       Version 1.0, April 2012

This program generates TeX commands to typeset pedigrees - either TeX
fragments of full LaTeX files.  It has support for multilanguage
pedigrees (at the present moment English and Russian languages are
supported).

To create manual pages for this program, issue make in the main
directory.  To install the program and the library files issue make
install (this command assumes location /usr/local/bin/ for the
binaries and /usr/local/lib/site_perl for Perl libraries).  Optionally
you can install manual pages to the proper location on your system.
The typeset manual in in the doc subdirectory.

    and move there all .pm modules.

3.  Optionally install man pages & documentation.
