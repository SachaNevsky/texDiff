	If you are using git to control versions of \LaTeX-files, you may want to show yourself or
	other users or devs the current version of the file, information about the author and last
	edited date. All packages for git known make that kind of information available for the whole
	repository. But sometimes you have a lot of files within the same repository in different
	versions, from different authors etc. Perhaps you also split up a big project in small files
	and want to show within the document who had edited what. This package gives you the
	opportunity to do so.
