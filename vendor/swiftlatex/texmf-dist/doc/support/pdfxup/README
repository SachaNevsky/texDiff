PDFXUP -- v1.51 (2020/01/06)
N. Markey <pdfxup@markey.fr>


pdfxup is a bash shell script that creates a PDF document where each
page is obtained by combining several pages of a PDF file given as
output. The important feature of pdfxup, compared to similar programs,
is that it tries to compute the (global) bounding box of the input PDF
file, in order to remove the margins and to keep the text only.
Instead of having the font size divided by 2 (for the case of 2-up
output), in some case you may end up with the same font size as in the
original document (as is the case for a default 'article' document
produced by LaTeX).

pdfxup uses ghostscript for computing the maximal bounding box of
(some of) the pages of the document, and then uses pdflatex (with
graphicx package) in order to produce the new document.
