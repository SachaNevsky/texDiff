This is the README for the tinos package, version
2017-01-05.

This package provides LaTeX, pdfLaTeX, XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX
support for the Tinos family of fonts, designed by Steve
Matteson. Tinos is an innovative, refreshing serif design
that is metrically compatible with Times New Roman. Tinos
offers improved on-screen readability characteristics and
the pan-European WGL character set and solves the needs of
developers looking for width-compatible fonts to address
document portability across platforms.

To install this package on a TDS-compliant TeX system
download the file "tex-archive"/install/fonts/tinos.tds.zip
where the preferred URL for "tex-archive" is
http://mirrors.ctan.org. Unzip the archive at the root
of an appropriate texmf tree, likely a personal or local
tree. If necessary, update the file-name database (e.g.,
texhash). Update the font-map files by enabling the Map file
tinos.map.

To use, add

\usepackage{tinos}

to the preamble of your document. These will activate Tinos
as the main (serifed) text font.

LuaLaTeX and xeLaTeX users who might prefer type1 fonts or
who wish to avoid fontspec may use the type1 option.

Options scaled=<number> or scale=<number> may be used to
scale the fonts.

Font encodings supported are OT1, T1, LY1 and TS1.
