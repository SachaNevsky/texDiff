The DSSerif Font Package
--------------------------

DSSerif is a small font package intended to provide yet another blackboard bold alphabet. The shapes, in regular and bold weights, are derived from the URW++ clones (version 2) of Courier with stem widths increased to match those of STIX Blackboard Bold (44 uits for regular, 70 for bold) and blackboard bolding done as in STIX. Serifs were shortened and heights increased to make a better match to Times and STIXTwo.

The fonts are provided in PostScript formats. As allowed by the 2017  URW++ triple license, they are released under your choice of LPPL (described in the next paragraph) and SIL's OFL, details of which are spelled out in the file OFL.txt accompanying the package.

The TeX font metrics, font definition files and other support files for DSSerif,
i.e., the other files in the archive DSSerif.zip, may be distributed and/or modified
under the conditions of the LaTeX Project Public License, either version 1.3 of
this license or (at your option) any later version.  The latest version of this

part of all distributions of LaTeX version 2003/12/01 or later.
