The logix package.

This is the README for the logix package, version 2020-01-04 v1.02.

*** Important! *** ********************************************************

Due to changes in a number of base packages, a number of other packages
have been broken. To the best of my knowledge (as of the date above) the
only remaining package that is broken and that affects using this package
is filehook-scrlfile. If you get an error message such as:

   LaTeX Warning: Command \InputIfFileExists  has changed.

   Package filehook Error: Detected 'scrlfile' package with unknown definition of \InputIfFileExists.

Then goto

   https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/515183/48973

and copy the code into a file named "filehook-scrlfile.sty" and place
it in your local directory. When filehook-scrlfile has been updated, this
local file should be removed.

***************************************************************************

This package provides supplemental symbols for use in logic and mathematics
which are largely not present in Unicode. Some symbols are in Unicode but
are included because they are variants that may look better in some 
applications. Logic tends not to have the complex layouts that is common for 
more general mathematics, but has different requirements for readability.
This font is intended to complement, but not replace the AMS STIX2 fonts. 
However, it may used with any mathematical font since it does not replace or 
redefine any symbols. This package also provides an environment for drawing
knots using the \Knt drawing symbols and three environments for Hilbert style
logic definitions and theorems.

This is an OpenType font where all of the symbols (more than 4,000) other than 
the ASCII codepage are in the private use area. As such, the package requires
XeLaTeX or LuaLaTeX. Not all of those symbols are directly exported, since
there are many variants present for possible future use. While only the 
OpenType font file is usable for LaTeX, the .ttf, .woff, .woff2 and .eot font
files are also supplied in this distribution.

Other than many miscellaneous symbols, there are a large number of arrows, 
geometrical symbols, Knot drawing symbols, 68 stretchy delimiters plus a
stretchy binding bar, of which 60 are fully stretchable. The remaining 8 are
stretchy up to 5 times the original size. Some of the delimiters are present
in Unicode, but their design in STIX2 does not work as well for logic. In
particular, STIX2 delimiters tend to not extend as far below the baseline
and above the baseline as would be desirable. Also, some STIX2 delimiters
take more horizontal space than is necessary.

There are twenty scripts, each of which (except for the two Greek scripts) 
have matching numeric, lower case and upper case glyphs. All symbols in this 
font are designed to be compatible with the STIX2 mathematical font by AMS.
Some of these scripts overlap the Unicode math scripts, but are not intended 
to be replacements for those. Unicode does not include everything for a specific
script -- digits or lower case may be missing, or even individual letters 
(although that may have changed). That is an issue when using a script for 
variable naming.  Some script variants are omitted. Many of those variants are 
useful in logic. The scripts included are sans serif, slab serif, normal serif 
(each of these has upright, italic, bold and bold italic versions) as well as 
a calligraphic font, blackboard, fraktur (upright and bold), monospace, 
monospace italic with normal serif, and Greek (upright and italic).

This work has the LPPL maintenance status `maintained'.

The Current Maintainer of this work is Michael Lee Finney who can be reached 
at ctan@metachaos.net.

This work consists of the files CHANGELOG, README, logix.sty, logix.tex, logix.pdf, 
logix.otf, logix.ttf, logix.woff, logix.woff2, logix.eot and logix.vfc.

To use this package, add

   \usepackage{logix}

it has no options. If the array package is used, it must be loaded prior to the
logix package due to a conflict between the array package and the arydshln
package. The public interface is defined in logix.sty and documented in logix.pdf.
For example:

   \usepackage{array}            % Only if required, must load before logix.
   \usepackage{logix}            % Load logix font for supplemental symbols.

   \setmainfont{STIX Two Text}   % AMS STIX2 used for main font.
   \setmathfont{STIX Two Math}   % AMS STIX2 used for math font.

This distribution also contains logix.vfc, which is the master font file used to
derive the actual font files. It is not needed for LaTeX usage, but is provided
should I become unable to maintain the package, and it is picked up by another
maintainer. This is a FontLab (currently version 7.0.1) source file.

As briefly mentioned above, the various web font files (.eot, .ttf, .woff and
.woff2) are provided so that any user who wishes to use the font on a web page
does not need to convert font files.

Users can report bugs or request support at

   ctan@metachaos.net
   
which is an email address devoted exclusively to my interaction with CTAN. 
There are no web pages, URLs, repositories etc. that the user can access.
