   \section{Introduction: logix 2020-01-04 v1.02}

   The logix package provides the logix Unicode font and, at this time, must be used either
   with \LuaLaTeX\ or \XeLaTeX. There are no available options. The logix font contains
   supplemental symbols for logic and mathematics, most of which are not found in Unicode.
   All of the symbols, with the exception of those in the ASCII code space, are in Unicode's
   Private Use Area. This package does not replace either the text font or the math font.

   The logix package includes, in turn, the ifxetex, ifluatex, unicode-math and arydshln
   packages. The unicode-math package includes the fontspec package. The arydsln package
   conflicts with several packages. Documented conflicts are the array, longtable, colortab
   and colortbl packages, which must be loaded before the logix package. Typical use of
   the logix package in a \LaTeX\ source file is:
   \vspace{-0.5em}

\begin{verbatim}
   \usepackage{array}   % Optional, only if otherwise required.
   \usepackage{logix}
   \setmainfont{STIX Two Text}
   \setmathfont{STIX Two Math}
\end{verbatim}
   \vspace{-0.5em}

   \noindent although the \AmS{} STIX2 fonts may be included prior to the logix package,
   provided that the unicode-math package is loaded first.

   The metrics for the logix font are identical to the STIX2 mathematical font and,
   overall, the symbols in the logix font are designed to be compatible with the
   STIX2 mathematical font. It may, of course, be used with any other mathematical font.
   There are more than 3,000 symbols exported from the font (of which around 1,000 are
   for \enquote{stretchy} delimiters). The font itself contains over 4,000 symbols,
   but those which are not exported are usually variants (e.g. thinner or thicker) or
   unused experimental symbols. Other symbols could be exported, but have neither
   suggested usage nor name at this time.

   Should you wish to use a non-exported symbol, please contact the author with a quick
   explanation of your use (so a reasonable name can be assigned) and, as the author's time
   permits, the requested symbol can be exported (once a name has been assigned, the requestor
   can then make a quick patch to their logix.sty file for immediate usage). Symbol names
   in the font file are the same as the \LaTeX\ macro for the symbol with the exception of
   the ASCII code page since those names potentially conflict with existing \LaTeX\ names.
   Otherwise, if a symbol does not have a name, then it is not exported.
   
   Should you want an entirely new symbol, that is also possible \textemdash\ but may take
   more time depending on difficulty and available time. Of course, petitioning the
   gatekeepers of Unicode to add any of the symbols here which are not in Unicode and have
   been used in publication is possible, but time-consuming. No assurences are made about
   the Unicode codepoint (or even font file) for any symbol in the font. Those may change
   with updates to this package. Use the provided macro names and not the Unicode codepoints.

   The international organizations that maintain Unicode and ISO 10646
   live in time frames more appropriate to watching trees grow than users' time frames.
   This font allows a more rapid response, permitting new symbols to be added simply
   because someone wants to try one out. That is entirely how this font came into
   existence, the author found that Unicode simply did not have enough arrows for use in
   logic and what was there was poorly designed for the purpose and inconsistent to boot.
   Many non-exported symbols are variants on arrows or ordering operators.

   Formal logic expressions differ from mathematical expressions in several ways. First,
   layout is typically linear rather than the more complex two-dimensional layout more
   often found in mathematical expressions. Next, most logical operators tend to occur
   between lower case alphabetic symbols, so many operators for mathematics are too large
   or their center is too high. Finally, delimiters used for mathematical expressions are
   typically neither tall enough or deep enough for good readability. Thus, many operators
   which have a good appearance in mathematical expressions are not as appropriate for
   logical expressions.
   \clearpage
   
   Symbols in the logix font which are also in Unicode are typically glyph variants that
   are designed to better accommodate formal logic expressions. These may occur in the
   same document as the mathematical variants, and so are not assigned the Unicode
   codepoints of the mathematical variants.

   This package provides 34 stretchy delimiters, each of which has a left and right variant.
   There is also a stretchy binding bar, commonly used with set notation. Of those 34
   delimiters, 4 are only stretchy up to a point (5 times original height). All of the
   remaining delimiters may be of arbitrary size. At this time, there are no horizontal
   stretchy operators. However, the function arrow and the logic implication arrows have
   four available lengths. If {\textbackslash}Delim is a stretchy symbol, then
   {\textbackslash}DelimX (where X is A\textendash{L} or A\textendash{P}) are explicit
   larger sizes of {\textbackslash}Delim. Additionally, {\textbackslash}DelimS is
   automatically stretchy, so the use of {\textbackslash}left, {\textbackslash}middle or
   {\textbackslash}right is not necessary. In the case of {\textbackslash}middle, a
   {\textbackslash}left and {\textbackslash}right are still required in the expression.

   A large set of arrows is provided for potential function variants. Arrows are provided
   to distinguish between 8 types of logic. The distinctions are largely for naming purposes,
   since there is no real consensus for their use \textemdash\ although some are most
   frequently associated with classical logic. Various flavors of turnstiles (and their
   negations) are also provided. There is more of a consensus for their usage although the
   author has only seen two publications with the very useful sequent ({\textbackslash}Seq)
   symbol. Additional arrows are provided as an alternative to the slash typically used for
   replacement in quantification and arrows are provided for shift operators.

   Many basic logic symbols are provided (including some experimental) along with a small
   collection of punctuation symbols. Operators for choice, least and greatest fixed points
   are provided. A number of modal operators are provided, but are by no means comprehensive.
   As with arrows, modal operators are frequently reused so names are merely suggestive and
   convenient. There are many other geometric symbols which are suitable for, and (often
   have been used for), other modal operators. Explicit names for some of those could be
   provided. Operators are provided to work with \enquote{bunches} which are like lists or
   sets but without the packaging. Ordering operators (and their negations) are provided
   \textemdash\ however there are additional ordering operators which are not exported.

   \section{Scripts}

   Often in logic, it is desirable to distinguish different types using script variants.
   Unicode is lacking in this area \textemdash\ it does not always provide either all
   symbols for a script (e.g. missing digits) or all variants for a script (e.g. normal,
   oblique, bold and bold oblique). Slab serif scripts are not provided by Unicode at
   all. To alleviate this, 20 supplemental scripts are provided. None of these scripts
   are intended to replace the scripts used in normal mathematical practice. These scripts
   contain only digits and letters.

   Each script is identified by three letters. The first two letters provide the major
   classification of the font and the case of the first letter combined with the last letter
   provides the script variation. If the first letter is lower case, then the script has a
   normal weight and if the first letter is upper case then the script has a heavier weight
   (bold). If the last letter is 'u' then the script is upright and if it is 'i' then the
   script is oblique.

   \begin{tabular}{ L{0.20in} L{0.9in} L{1.0in} L{0.20in} L{0.9in} L{1.0in} }
      sa & Sans serif   & sau, sai, Sau, Sai & bl & Blackboard & blu      \\
      sl & Slab serif   & slu, sli, Slu, Sli & fr & Fraktur    & fru, Fru \\
      sr & Normal serif & sru, sri, Sru, Sri & mn & Monospace  & mnu, mni \\
      cl & Calligraphic & cli                & gr & Greek      & gru, gri \\
      \end{tabular}

   There is a macro defined for each script and each digit or letter, where the name of the
   macro is the 3-character identifier of the script, as defined above, followed by the name
   of the digit (zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight or nine) or by the
   name of the letter (a{\textendash}z or A{\textendash}Z). Greek scripts do not have digits,
   and the name of the letter is used instead (e.g. alpha, beta, \textellipsis). For example,
   {\textbackslash}SluX is a slab serif, bold upper case '\SluX'.
   \clearpage
   
   There is a special script variant \enquote{Knt} which is the same as the \enquote{mni}
   script, except that it is raised above the normal baseline. It is intended for use with
   the Knt symbols.

   Each of the scripts has a symXxx and a mathXxx macro with the exception of the special Knt
   script. Some scripts have a synonym for the symXxx macro (and for the individual macros whose
   prefixes have title case to avoid conflicts) to accommodate expected use in logic. For example,
   {\textbackslash}symsau\{p\} could also be written as {\textbackslash}saup, as {\textbackslash}prop\{p\}
   or as {\textbackslash}Propp. The scripts provided, and their macros, are:

   \section{Knot Symbols}

   An extensive set of drawing symbols is provided for drawing knots (as found in Knot Theory).
   The {\textbackslash}KnotGrid environment is provided for this purpose. KnotGrid provides a
   grid (based on tabular, but the use of ampersand (\&) separators is not required between
   grid cells). Each knot symbol has an exact width and height \textemdash\ most are 1em\times 1em,
   but a few are half or quarter height or width. Every symbol (or symbols) in a grid cell must
   have the same height as all other knot symbols in the same row and same width as all other
   knot symbols in the same column. The KnotGrid environment has no options and is used as follows
   (this example has three rows and five columns):
   \vspace{-0.50em}

\begin{verbatim}
\begin{KnotGrid}
  \KntLFC  \KntTSN     \KntHXSOSU  \KntTSFN        \KntTRSC \\
  \KntNF   \KntHXSUSO  \KntNN      \KntRQC \KntNQ  \KntRSN  \\
  \KntLFC  \KntBSN     \KntHXSOSU  \KntBSFN        \KntRBSC \\
  \end{KnotGrid}
\end{verbatim}
   \vspace{-0.75em}

   \noindent which produces the following knot diagram for the Trefoil knot.
   Note that the second row, fourth column contains two symbols whose combined
   width satisfies the width constraints.

   Where a grid cell would otherwise be empty or where padding is required to
   satisfy the size requirements for a cell, 25 KntXY (X is height, Y width, both
   are one of: N, E, F, Q, Z) space or strut symbols are provided which are exactly
   sized both horizontally and vertically to assist. The knot symbols are typeset
   in math mode so that spaces are ignored. This allows the grid structure to be
   explicit, making readability and maintenance easier. In the first example above
   (the Trefoil knot), the fourth grid column is 0.5em wide, but in the second row
   an 0.25em width symbol is used, which must then be padded with an 0.25em space.

   \section{Logic Proofs}

   \LaTeX\ has more than adequate support for traditional mathematical proofs.
   Conversely, in logic, object proofs are written either as a linear sequence
   (usually Hilbert systems) or as a tree (usually Natural Deduction or Gentzen
   systems), but linear proofs can be used with most systems of logic. Tree style
   proofs have support in several other packages. However, linear proofs do not.
   This package supplies three environments to support linear proofs to alleviate
   this deficiency.

   Logic definitions typically have a name with an optional number (e.g. \enquote{Ax. 3}
   or \enquote{Conjunction}), an expression and, optionally, a brief comment. Sometimes
   a definition stands alone and other times several definitions are associated in a
   group. The LogixDefn environment provides structured formatting for logic
   definitions, either singly or as a group. The LogixDefn environment does not have
   any required parameters and has an optional parameter. That parameter must be a
   horizontal length. If present, all of the definition expressions must fit within
   that length and its presence indicates that a comment may optionally follow each
   expression. The length should be sufficient to allow adequate space between the
   longest expression and the start of the comments to avoid the expressions
   overlapping the comments.

   The LogixDefn environment defines the nested Line macro, which has three parameters
   if the optional LogixDefn parameter is not present, and otherwise four. The
   fourth parameter may not be omitted if the length parameter is present and contains
   a possibly empty comment to be placed at the end of the line following the
   expression. The basic three parameters for the Line macro are the definition's name,
   optional number (the empty argument must be present if there is no number) and
   the definition expression, which is typeset in math mode. Two examples of its use
   follow. Expressions in most examples are meaningless and only serve to show the
   presence of an expression.

            \Line{Df}{2}{\symsau{p} \Equv \symsau{q}}{Yet another comment}
            \end{LogixDefn}
         \end{addmargin}
      \end{flushleft}
   \vspace{-0.50em}

   Environments defined in this package do not affect the indentation level.
   The LogixDefn environment would also be used to state axioms or theorems without
   associated proofs. In this document, the addmargin environment provided by the
   scrextend package is used to provide indentation.

   A linear logical theorem typically has a name (including any number), a possibly
   empty set of postulates and the theorem's expression. The LogixProof environment
   provides structured formatting for linear logic theorems. The LogixProof environment
   has four arguments with the first one optional. The optional argument is a horizontal
   length, and provides a width for the expression in each proof line which is followed
   by a comment when the length argument is present. The other three arguments are the
   name (and any associated number) of the theorem, a possibly empty set of postulates
   which are assumed only for the purpose of the proof (e.g. assuming the Axiom of
   Choice (AC) for a specific theorem when working in ZF instead of ZFC).
   
   \clearpage
   Thus, postulates are distinguished from axioms which are assumed to hold for all
   theorems in a system whereas a postulate holds only for a specific proof. The third
   parameter is the statement (the theorem's expression) of the proof.

   The LogixProof environment defines the Dash and Line nested macros. These are
   identical except that the Dash macro is followed by a dashed line separator and
   the Line macro is followed by a solid line separator. Each line of the proof is
   represented by an occurrence of one of these macros. The last line of the proof
   is normally represented by a Line macro. Each of these macros has four parameters
   (five when the optional length argument of the LogixProof environment is present).
   There are two typical styles for each line of a linear logical proof. The first
   is commonly used in short examples and in introductory texts. It starts with a
   line number, the expression for the proof line and an optional comment which
   justifies the proof step in some manner. The second style starts with a line
   number, then the justifying theorem or axiom name, then a list of previous line
   numbers of the proof that justify the proof step, followed by the expression for
   the proof line and, finally, an optional comment.

   The Dash and Line macros accommodate both proof styles. The first parameter for each
   of these macros is the line number. It is typeset in math mode so that subscripts
   may be used (sometimes useful in meta proofs). The second parameter is the name
   of the justifying axiom or previous theorem (including any number). The third
   parameter is the list of previous lines of the proof used to justify the proof,
   and the fourth parameter is the expression for the proof line. If the optional
   length is present for the LogixProof environment, then a parameter for the
   comment is present as the fifth parameter. A list is used for the previous
   justifying lines since the same line can be referenced more than once and the
   order is potentially significant. Both the second and third parameters may be
   empty, allowing the use of the optional comment for justification. The following
   examples illustrate the use of the LogixProof environment.

   Additionally, the LogixSeqnt environment is provided. It is identical to the
   LogixProof environment except that there are two expressions associated with
   each proof line. The first may be empty and contains the premises for a sequent
   and the second contains its conclusion. The proof expressions are aligned on
   the sequent operator, which is present in every line. The following
   examples illustrate the use of the LogixSeqnt environment.

   \section{Symbols}

   The remainder of this document is the list of symbols. Each symbol has a name
   (not necessarily definitive, but it corresponds to the name of the macro for
   the symbol), the name of the macro for the symbol and a scaled (by a factor
   of 1.5) example of the symbol. All symbols can be used in both text and in
   math mode.

   Following the individual symbols, the names for stretchy delimiters (and the
   stretchy binding bar) are shown with two examples. The first example is small
   enough that a predefined size variant will be used, and the second example is
   large enough that no predefined size variant will be used. Delimiters which
   are too short for the second example are limited in size variations to 5\times\
   the normal delimiter size.

   That is followed by script examples. First Greek and Greek italic, then the
   sans-serif scripts, the slab-serif scripts, the normal serif scripts and
   lastly the miscellaneous scripts (calligraphic, Fraktur, etc.).

   The logix.sty package file is heavily commented, and is useful as a
   quick reference.

   Please feel free to contact the author if you have questions or issues.
   The author will answer or attempt to resolve any issue as quickly as
   possible \textemdash\ constrained of course, by the author's available
   time and other constraints. The author can be contacted by email at

   ctan@metachaos.net

   \noindent Please allow a few days before emailing a second time. There
   is no spam filter on this email account. Under normal circumstances,
   this email account is checked at least daily.

   This distribution also contains logix.vfc, which is the master font file used to
   derive the actual font files. It is not needed for \LaTeX usage, but is provided
   should I become unable to maintain the package, and it is picked up by another
   maintainer. This is a FontLab source file.

   In addition, and also not required for \LaTeX\ usage, the various web font files
   (.eot, .ttf, .woff and .woff2) are included in the distribution so that users who
   wish to use the font in a web page do not need to convert font files.
