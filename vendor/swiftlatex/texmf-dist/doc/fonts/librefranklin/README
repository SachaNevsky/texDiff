This is the README for the librefranklin package, version
2019-10-23.

This package provides LaTeX, pdfLaTeX, XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX
support for the LibreFranklin family of sans serif fonts
(version 1.015), designed by Pablo Impallari, Rodrigo
Fuenzalida and Nhung Nguyen.

Libre Franklin is an interpretation and expansion based on
the 1912 Morris Fuller Benton's classic.

To install this package on a TDS-compliant
TeX system download the file
"tex-archive"/install/fonts/librefranklin.tds.zip, where the
preferred URL for "tex-archive" is http://mirror.ctan.org.
Unzip the archive at the root of an appropriate texmf tree,
likely a personal or local tree. If necessary, update the
file-name database (e.g., texhash). Update the font-map
files by enabling the Map file LibreFranklin.map.

To use, add

\usepackage{librefranklin}

to the preamble of your document. This makes LibreFranklin
the default sans family. To also set LibreFranklin as the
main text font, use

\usepackage[sfdefault]{librefranklin}

LuaLaTeX and xeLaTeX users who might prefer type1 fonts or who wish
to avoid fontspec may use the type1 option.

Other options include:

bold            
semibold        
extrabold
black

regular         
medium          
light
extralight
thin

These are implemented by defining macros recognized by commands
defined in package mweights (without re-defining \bfdefault or
\mddefault).

Defaults are regular and bold. 

Italics are available in all series.

Options scaled=<number> or scale=<number> may be used to adjust
fontsizes to match a serifed font.

Slanted variants are not supported; the designed italic variants will
be automatically substituted. 

The only figure style supported is tabular-lining. Font
encodings supported are OT1, T1, LY1 and TS1.

The original fonts are available at
https://github.com/impallari/Libre-Franklin/ and are
licensed under the SIL Open Font License, (version 1.1); the
text may be found in the doc directory. The support files
and type1 fonts were created using autoinst and otftotfm,
and are licensed under the terms of the LaTeX Project Public
License. The maintainer of this package is Bob Tennent
