This is the README for libertinus-type1, version 2019-12-17.

The Libertinus fonts are derived from the Linux Libertine
and Biolinum families of fonts. To use the OpenType fonts
with xelatex or lualatex, install the libertinus-fonts and
libertinus-otf packages. This package provides support for
use of Libertinus fonts with traditional processing engines
(latex with dvips or dvipdfmx, or pdflatex). 

To install this package on a TDS-compliant
TeX system download the file
"tex-archive"/install/fonts/libertinus-type1.tds.zip,
where the preferred URL for "tex-archive" is
http://mirror.ctan.org. Unzip the archive at the root of an
appropriate texmf tree, likely a personal or local tree.
If necessary, update the file-name database (e.g., texhash
texmf). Update the font-map files by enabling the Map file
libertinus.map.

For most purposes, simply add

\usepackage{libertinus}

to the preamble of your document. This will activate
Libertinus Serif as the main text font, Libertinus Sans
as the sans font and Libertinus Mono as the monospaced
font. It is recommended that the font encoding be set
to T1 or LY1, but the default OT1 encoding is also
supported. The LGR encoding is supported for the Serif
and Sans families. The T2A/B/C encodings are supported
for the Serif and Sans families and may be selected using
{\fontencoding{T2x}\selectfont ...}.

Available shapes in all series (except tt) include:

it              italic
sc              small caps
scit            italic small caps

Slanted variants are not supported; the designed italic
variants will be automatically substituted. The exception
is the bold series of Libertinus Sans, for which a designed
italic is not available. An artificially slanted variant has
been generated and treated as if it were italic.

To activate Libertinus Serif without Libertinus Sans or
Mono, use the serif (or rm) option. Similarly, to activate
Libertinus Sans (without Libertinus Serif or Mono), use the
sans (or sf or ss) option. To use Libertinus Sans as the
main text font (as well as the sans font), use the option
sfdefault. To suppress activating Libertinus Mono, use
mono=false (or tt=false).

Commands \libertinusseriflgr and \libertinussanslgr
select the LGR encoding for the Serif and Sans families,
respectively.

For more advanced usage, please see the libertinus-type1.pdf
document.
