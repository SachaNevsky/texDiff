This is the README for the coelacanth package, version 0.005
(2019-10-15).

This package provides LaTeX, pdfLaTeX, XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX
support for Coelecanth fonts, designed by Ben Whitmore.

Coelacanth is inspired by the classic Centaur type design
of Bruce Rogers, described by some as the most beautiful
typeface ever designed. It aims to be a professional quality
type family for general book typesetting.

Currently available in six weights for upright text, but
only a single italic font. 

To install this package on a TDS-compliant
TeX system download the file
"tex-archive"/install/fonts/coelacanth.tds.zip, where the
preferred URL for "tex-archive" is http://mirror.ctan.org.
Unzip the archive at the root of an appropriate texmf tree,
likely a personal or local tree. If necessary, update the
file-name database (e.g., texhash). Update the font-map
files by enabling the Map file Coelacanth.map.

To use, add

\usepackage{coelacanth}

to the preamble of your document. Options include:

oldstyle,osf    old-style figures
lining,nf,lf    lining figures

proportional,p  varying-width figures
tabular,t       fixed-width figures

The defaults are oldstyle and proportional.

The default weights are regular and bold but other weights
can be obtained by using the following options:

l               light
el              extra light

sb              semibold
h               heavy

Available shapes include:

sc              small caps

and, in regular weight only,

it              italic 
scit            italic small caps

Slanted variants are not supported; the italic variant will
be automatically substituted. Font encodings supported are
OT1, T1, LY1 and TS1.

Options scaled=<number> or scale=<number> may be used to
adjust fontsizes. The type1 option may be used by xelatex
or lualatex users who prefer to use type1 fonts or to avoid
fontspec.

Commands \oldstylenums{...} and \liningnums{...} are defined
to allow for local use of old-style figures or lining
figures, respectively. Similarly, \tabularnums{...} and
\proportionalnums{...} allow for local use of monospaced or
varying-width figures, respectively.

The type1 versions were created using cfftot1. The support
