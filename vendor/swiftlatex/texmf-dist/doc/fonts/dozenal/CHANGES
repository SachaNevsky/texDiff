For version 7.2, wrapped both \x and \e in \unexpanded, so
that dozenal would play nicely with the texdate package.

For version 7.1, I finally realized that lualatex will choke
on the dozenal package, because it calls \pdfmapfile.  I
realized this because I finally started using lualatex
regularly.  This was fixed by requiring ifluatex and
defining \pdfmapfile if luatex is being used.  Submitted to
CTAN on 1 July 1201 (1 July 2017).

For version 7.0, added the "\doman" and "\Doman" macros for
dozenal-style Roman numerals.  Also reorganized the
documentation.  Submitted to CTAN on 25 Nov 1200 (29 Nov
2016).

For version 6.0, added the "\doznumtowords" macro, which
will take a counter and output it in dozenal words.  Which
words it uses can be customized; I have made no attempt to
internationalize this will different languages, because I
haven't the foggiest how to do so other than simply writing
option packs with different definitions in them.  Also did a
complete rewrite of |\basex|, so its workings are now
(almost) comprehensible.  Finally, darkened the tally marks
and put in hand-written italic shapes.

For version 5.3, removed a conflict with another package
that defined an "\X" and "\E" command by adding a "doz@"
prefix to these.  Also made the tally marks work with the
Type1 fonts.

For version 5.2, removed some contradiction in the code about
version numbers.  Completely redid the conversions to Type1
fonts, so now they work consistently.  Did away with the
"fdz" prefix for these.  Substantially reworked the
documentation.

For version 5.1, and four files had CRLF line endings; also,
the version was incorrectly reported in the \ProvidesPackage
line.  These problems are now fixed.

For version 5.0, the documentation and code structure was
substantially cleansed, and a git repository was created for
the package.  I've also added the appropriate fontdimens to
the font files, so that microtype won't complain about them.
Finally, I've added \basex, a macro which will convert
dozenal numbers to base X, but doesn't work on counters,
which is frustrating.

For version 4.0, I've included the tally mark characters, as
well, for whatever they may be worth.  The documentation
also now contains examples of the characters.  Finally,
there's also an option to make available the dozenal
characters without dozenalizing every counter.  Submitted to
CTAN on 17 May 11E9 (decimal 19 May 2013).

For version 3.3, I was kindly notified by Karl Berry that
the Type 1 italic TFM wasn't properly formed; I switched
from mftrace to mf2pt1 for converting from Metafont, and
this seems to have resolved the problem.  Submitted to CTAN
on 3 Nov 11E8 (decimal 2012).

For version 3.2, I've made minor changes because a new
version of hyperref for some reason seemed to break things,
for reasons that aren't really clear to me.  Submitted to
CTAN on 13 May 2012.

For version 3.1, I've updated things to allow TeXLive to
install the package correctly automatically; previously,
some manual work was required.  This was essentially just
adding a \pdfmapfile statement to dozenal.sty.  Submitted to
CTAN on 25 November 2009.

For version 3.0, I was kindly informed that my \x was
actually a backwards Pitman ten; so I fixed that, which
included redrawing the italics font (the rest were simply
mirrored).  Also, made the version numbers "real" by
including them in the \ProvidesPackage command; thanks to
Robin Fairbairns for telling me to.

For version 2.0, Type 1 versions of the fonts were uploaded.
Some trouble with the normal weight italic, which is
therefore replaced with the simple slanted version.  Was
annoyed at having to do this at all; only did it because
acroread is terrible and won't display bitmap fonts
properly.  Submitted to CTAN on 2 July 2009.

For version 1.3, \mainmatter's slaughter of the dozenal
counter redefinitions was stopped.  Submitted to CTAN on 20
June 2009.

For version 1.2, support for using dozenal characters in
math mode was added.  Submitted to CTAN on 6 June 2009.

For version 1.1, minor bugs, in which section and subsection
numbers were not properly redefined, have been fixed.
