This package provides three Postscript Type 1 mini-fonts cmrj,
cmssj, plrj (and associated map file and metric files) with just
five "ligatures" for the combinations 2+, 4+, 5+, 6+, and 9+ used
in figured-bass notation in baroque music. The fonts are intended
for use with Computer Modern (cmr), Computer Modern Sans (cmss), and
Palatino/Palladio (pplr), respectively.

Installation
------------

Unzip the archive tex-archive/install/fonts/figbas.tds.zip at the root  
of a texmf hierarchy, preferably a "local" tree, such as $HOME/texmf    
or /usr/local/share/texmf on a Un*x-like system or C:\localtexmf on a   
Windows system; the documentation of your TeX distribution should tell  
you where to install new files.                                         

Updating the Filename Database
------------------------------

Most TeX systems improve the efficiency of file access by maintaining
a data base of file names. The documentation of your TeX distribution
should tell you what you have to do to update this data base after
adding new files. For example, on a teTeX-based system, execute

  texhash

On a MikTeX system, execute

  initexmf -u

or click on Options and then the Refresh button for the file-name       
database.                                                       


Configuring the Font Maps
-------------------------

TeX systems maintain map files which associate font files with font     
names. The file figbas.map in the archive defines the appropriate       
associations for these fonts. The documentation of your TeX             
distribution should tell you what you have to do to add the             
associations in figbas.map to the global map file or files. For         
example, on a TeXLive system, execute                        

  updmap --enable Map=figbas.map

or add 

  Map figbas.map 

to updmap.cfg and run updmap (as a user) or updmap-sys (as root).

On a MikTeX system: 

  + Run 

initexmf --edit-config-file updmap

and add the following at the end of the file:

Map figbas.map

  + Save the file and exit Notepad.
  
  + Refresh the file-name database and run 

initexmf --mkmaps 


Using the Fonts
---------------

The fonts might be used in a TeX-based format such as MusixTeX as
follows:

  % Uncomment one of the following three lines:
  % \font\figfont=cmr7           \font\figplus=cmrj at 7pt   
  % \font\figfont=cmss8 at 7pt   \font\figplus=cmssj at 7pt
    \font\figfont=pplr8r at 7pt  \font\figplus=plrj at 7pt   

    \def\twopl{\figplus 2}
    \def\fourpl{\figplus 4}
    \def\fivepl{\figplus 5}
    \def\sixpl{\figplus 6}
    \def\ninepl{\figplus 9}
