This is the README for the crimson package, 
version 2017-03-16.

This package provides LaTeX, pdfLaTeX, XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX
support for the Crimson Text family of fonts, designed
by Sebastian Kosch. The Crimson Text family is for book
production in the tradition of beautiful oldstyle typefaces,
inspired particularly by the fantastic work of people like
Jan Tschichold (Sabon), Robert Slimbach (Arno, Minion) and
Jonathan Hoefler (Hoefler Text).

Support for small caps and old-style numerals is still
"under construction"; this version of the package does not
support these features.

To install this package on a TDS-compliant
TeX system download the file
"tex-archive"/install/fonts/crimson.tds.zip where the
preferred URL for "tex-archive" is http://mirrors.ctan.org.
Unzip the archive at the root of an appropriate texmf tree,
likely a personal or local tree. If necessary, update the
file-name database (e.g., texhash). Update the font-map
files by enabling the Map file crimson.map.

To use, add

\usepackage{crimson}

to the preamble of your document. This will activate Crimson
Text as the main (serifed) text font.

LuaLaTeX and xeLaTeX users who might prefer type1 fonts or who wish
to avoid fontspec may use the type1 option.

Options scaled=<number> or scale=<number> may be used to scale the
fonts.

Option semibold (or sb) will activate the semi-bold variant
as the default bold face.  Localized use of semi-bold is
available using the \crimsonsemibold command

Font encodings supported are OT1, T1, LY1 and TS1.

The OpenType fonts were obtained from

https://github.com/skosch/Crimson 

in the Desktop Fonts folder
and are licensed under the SIL Open Font License, version
1.1; the text may be found in the doc directory. The type1
versions were created by otftotfm. The support files were
created using autoinst and are licensed under the terms of
the LaTeX Project Public License. The maintainer of this
package is Bob Tennent (rdt at cs.queensu.ca)
