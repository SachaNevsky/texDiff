typicons -- Another set of high quality web icons

The "typicons" package grants access to 336 web-related icons provided by the
included "Typicons" free font, designed by Stephen Hutchings and released under
the open SIL Open Font License (available at http://scripts.sil.org/OFL).
See http://www.typicons.com/ for more details about the font itself.

This package requires the "fontspec" package and either the Xe(La)TeX or
Lua(La)TeX engine to load the included ttf font.

Once the package is loaded, icons can be accessed through the general \ticon
command, which takes as argument the name of the desired icon, or through direct
commands specific to each icon. The full list of icon designs, names and direct
commands is showcased in the manual.
