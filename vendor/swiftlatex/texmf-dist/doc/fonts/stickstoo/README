The SticksToo Font Package
--------------------------

SticksToo is a reworking of some of the fonts in the newly released STIX2 font package and the STIX2 beta font package from 2016 to allow LaTeX users to make better use of some of the text features of STIX2. A companion release of newtx, version 1.55, contains an option stix2 that uses Roman and Greek letters together with newtxmath symbols, as a work-around for some current problems with STIX2 math rendering in LaTeX.

The fonts are provided in PostScript format. As the STIX2 fonts are released under the SIL's OFL, so are the fonts in SticksToo. The details of this license are spelled out in the file OFL.txt accompanying this package.

The TeX font metrics, font definition files and other support files for SticksToo,
i.e., the other files in the archive SticksToo.zip, may be distributed and/or modified
under the conditions of the LaTeX Project Public License, either version 1.3 of
this license or (at your option) any later version.  The latest version of this
license is in http://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt and version 1.3 or later is
part of all distributions of LaTeX version 2003/12/01 or later. 

The font files and the LaTeX support files are
