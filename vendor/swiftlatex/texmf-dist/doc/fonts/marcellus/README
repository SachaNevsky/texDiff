This is the README for the marcellus package, version
2019-10-13.

This package provides LaTeX, pdfLaTeX, XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX
support for the Marcellus family of fonts, designed by
Brian J. Bonislawsky. Marcellus is a flared-serif family, 
inspired by classic Roman inscription letterforms.  There is
currently just a regular weight and small-caps. The regular
weight will be silently substituted for bold.

To install this package on a TDS-compliant
TeX system download the file
"tex-archive"/install/fonts/marcellus.tds.zip where the
preferred URL for "tex-archive" is http://mirrors.ctan.org.
Unzip the archive at the root of an appropriate texmf tree,
likely a personal or local tree. If necessary, update the
file-name database (e.g., texhash). Update the font-map
files by enabling the Map file marcellus.map.

To use, add

\usepackage{marcellus}

to the preamble of your document. This will activate
Marcellus as the main (serifed) text font.

LuaLaTeX and xeLaTeX users who might prefer type1 fonts or
who wish to avoid fontspec may use the type1 option.

Options scaled=<number> or scale=<number> may be used to
scale the fonts.

The only figure style is proportional lining.

Font encodings supported are OT1, T1, LY1, and TS1.

The original Truetype fonts were obtained from

https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Marcellus

and are licensed under the SIL Open Font License, 
version 1.1; the text may be found in the doc directory. 
The type1 versions were created using fontforge. The
support files were created using autoinst and otftotfm and
are licensed under the terms of the LaTeX Project Public
License. The maintainer of this package is Bob Tennent (rdt
at cs.queensu.ca)
