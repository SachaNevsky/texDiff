Frederika2016 is an attempt to digitize Hermann Zapf's Frederika font.
The font is the Greek companion of Virtuosa by the same designer.
This font is a calligraphy font and it is quite possible that some
kerning pairs are simply missing. Thus I would really appreciate it if 
users could provide feedback and report errors and/or omissions.
