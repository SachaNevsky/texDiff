This is the README for the noto package, version 2019-12-09.

This package provides LaTeX, pdfLaTeX, XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX
support for the NotoSerif, NotoSans and NotoSansMono
families of fonts, designed by Steve Matteson for Google.

To install this package on a TDS-compliant TeX system
download the file "tex-archive"/install/fonts/noto.tds.zip,
where the preferred URL for "tex-archive" is
http://mirror.ctan.org. Unzip the archive at the root of an
appropriate texmf tree, likely a personal or local tree. If
necessary, update the file-name database (e.g., texhash).
Update the font-map files by enabling the Map file noto.map.

To use, add

\usepackage{noto}

to the preamble of your document. This will activate
NotoSerif as the main (serifed) text font, NotoSans as the
sans font and NotoSansMono as the fixed-width font.

To activate NotoSerif without NotoSans, use

\usepackage[rm]{noto}

or

\usepackage{noto-serif}.

Similarly, to activate NotoSans without NotoSerif use

\usepackage[sf]{noto} 

or

\usepackage{noto-sans}

To use NotoSans as the main text font, use the

  sfdefault

option.

This re-defines \familydefault, not \rmdefault. LuaLaTeX and
xeLaTeX users who might prefer type1 fonts or who wish to
avoid fontspec may use the type1 option. Use option nott to
avoid activating NotoMono as the fixed-width font.

To active just NotoSansMono, use

\usepackage{noto-mono}

Options scaled=<number> or scale=<number> may be used to
scale the NotoSans and NotoSansMono fonts; the serifed
variants are not affected unless noto-serif is being used.

Font encodings supported are OT1, T1, TS1, LY1, LGR and
T2A/B/C.

The following options may be used:

  pf proportional
  osf oldstyle
  lf lining
  tf tabular

The default figures are lining-tabular. NotoSansMono has
only tabular figures.

Superior numbers (for footnote markers) are available
using \sufigures or \textsu{...}.

  thin
  extralight
  light
  regular
  medium

The default weight is Regular.

  semibold
  bold
  extrabold
  black

The default bold weight is Bold.

  condensed
  semicondensed
  extracondensed

These are only effective for NotoSans and NotoSansMono.

The mono family does not currently have italics.

Macros \notoserif, \notosans and \notomono select the
NotoSerif, NotoSans and NotoMono families, respectively,
and \notoseriflgr, \notosanslgr and \notomonolgr
activate the LGR encoding.

Macros \notosanscondensed, \notosanssemicondensed,
\notosansextracondensed, \notomonocondensed,
\notomonosemicondensed and \notomonoextracondensed
select condensed weights for NotoSans or NotoSansMono.
