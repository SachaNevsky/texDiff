This is the README for the plex package, version 2019-12-06.

This package provides LaTeX, pdfLaTeX, XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX
support for the IBMPlex families of fonts. Serif, Sans,
Sans-Condensed and Mono families are available in eight
weights: Regular, Light, ExtraLight, Thin, Bold, Text,
Medium and SemiBold (with corresponding italics).

To install this package on a TDS-compliant TeX system
download the file "tex-archive"/install/fonts/plex.tds.zip
where the preferred URL for "tex-archive" is
http://mirrors.ctan.org. Unzip the archive at the root of an
appropriate texmf tree, likely a personal or local tree. If
necessary, update the file-name database (e.g., texhash).
Update the font-map files by enabling the Map file plex.map.

To use, add any of

\usepackage{plex-serif}
\usepackage{plex-sans}
\usepackage{plex-mono}

to the preamble of your document. These will activate
IBMPlexSerif, IBMPlexSans and/or IBMPlexMono as the serif,
sans or mono font, respectively. To activate the Sans font
as the main text font, use

\usepackage[sfdefault]{plex-sans}

LuaLaTeX and xeLaTeX users who might prefer type1 fonts or
who wish to avoid fontspec may use the type1 option. 

Option scale=<number> may be used to scale the fonts.

Option condensed for plex-sans selects the condensed
versions as the default. Commands \plexsans and
\plexsanscondensed allow for local use of the non-default
sans family. Command \plexsanslgr activates the LGR encoding.

Font encodings supported are OT1, T1, TS1 and LY1 (and LGR
for plex-sans).

The following options select lighter bold fonts:

  sb semibold
  mb medium
  tx text

and the following options select lighter regular fonts:

  l  light
  el extralight
  t  thin

For slightly heavier regular fonts use the options

  txmd textmd

The nomap option to plex-mono will suppress the tex-text
mapping of TeX "smart quotes" and other ligatures into
unicode glyphs for xeLaTeX and luaLaTeX.
