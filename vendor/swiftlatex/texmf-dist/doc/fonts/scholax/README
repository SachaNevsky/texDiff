The ScholaX Font Package
========================

ScholaX is made up of text fonts based on TeXGyreSchola, extended to include a quite full set of superior letters and figures and a set of inferior figures. The italic face has been enhanced wth upright punctuation glyphs so that a special theorem font can be made available. Math support is available via newtxmath using one of two options: option "nc" (for New Century [Schoolbook]) uses the newtx Greek alphabets, while option "ncf" uses Greek math alphabets derived from those in the Fourier package. The additions to TeXGyreSchola, named TeXGyreScholaX, and the revisions/additions to the Fourier Greek alphabets are copyright (c) 2019 by Michael Sharpe. The first release was dated 2019-12-30.

LICENCE
The licence of fourier-GUTenberg is LPPL (Latex Public
Project Licence) and the licence for TeXGyre fonts is equivalent to the LPPL, so this package is released under the LPPL.
