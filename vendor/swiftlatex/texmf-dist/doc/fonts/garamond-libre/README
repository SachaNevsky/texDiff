Garamond Libre, version 1.1 (July 21, 2019)

Garamond Libre is a free and open-source old-style font family. It is a "true Garamond," i.e., it is based off the designs of 16th-century French engraver Claude Garamond (also spelled Garamont). The Roman design is Garamond's; the italics are from a design by Robert Granjon. The upright Greek font is after a design by Firmin Didot; the "italic" Greek font is after a design by Alexander Wilson. The font family includes support for Latin, Greek (monotonic and polytonic) and Cyrillic scripts, as well as small capitals, old-style figures, superior and inferior figures, historical ligatures, Byzantine musical symbols, the IPA and swash capitals. Currently, regular, italic and bold fonts are provided; there is no set timeframe for the completion of a bold italic. The fonts are provided in OpenType format, and are intended to be used with LuaLaTeX or XeLaTeX via fontspec.
