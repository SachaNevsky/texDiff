Description:
Inria is  a free  font designed by  Black[Foundry] for  Inria research
institute. The  font is available for  free.  It comes Serif  and Sans
Serif, each with 3 weights and matching italics.

Using these  fonts with  XƎLATEX and  LuaLATEX is  easy, by  using the
fontspec package;  we refer to the documentation  of fontspec for more
information. The  present package  provides a way  of using  them with
LaTeX and  pdfLaTeX: it provides  two style files,  InriaSerif.sty and
InriaSans.sty, together with  the postscript version of  the fonts and
their associated files. These were created using autoinst.


Installation:
To  install  on  a  TDS-compliant   TEX  system,  first  download  the
inriafonts.tds.zip file  from CTAN, and  unzip it  at the root  of the
texmf  tree  where  you  want  to install  the  font.  Then  add  maps
InriaSerif.map and InriaSans.map  to updmap, and update  the font maps
and list of files.
