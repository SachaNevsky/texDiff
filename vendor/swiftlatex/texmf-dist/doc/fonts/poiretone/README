This is the README for the poiretone package, version
2019-06-18.

This package provides LaTeX, pdfLaTeX, XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX
support for the PoiretOne family of fonts, designed by Denis
Masharov. PoiretOne is a decorative geometric grotesque with
a hint of Art Deco and constructivism. There is currently
just a regular weight and an artificially emboldened bold.

To install this package on a TDS-compliant
TeX system download the file
"tex-archive"/install/fonts/poiretone.tds.zip where the
preferred URL for "tex-archive" is http://mirrors.ctan.org.
Unzip the archive at the root of an appropriate texmf tree,
likely a personal or local tree. If necessary, update the
file-name database (e.g., texhash). Update the font-map
files by enabling the Map file PoiretOne.map.

To use, add

\usepackage{PoiretOne}

to the preamble of your document. This will activate
Marcellus as the sans text font. To also set PoiretOne as
the main text font, use the option sfdefault.

LuaLaTeX and xeLaTeX users who might prefer type1 fonts or
who wish to avoid fontspec may use the type1 option.

Options scaled=<number> or scale=<number> may be used to
scale the fonts.

The only figure style is proportional lining.

Font encodings supported are OT1, T1, LY1, and TS1.

The original Truetype regular font was obtained from

https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poiret+One

and are licensed under the SIL Open Font License, version
1.1; the text may be found in the doc directory. The
type1 versions were created by ccftot1. The bold font was
generated using fontforge. The support files were created
using autoinst and otftotfm and are licensed under the terms
of the LaTeX Project Public License. The maintainer of this
package is Bob Tennent (rdt at cs.queensu.ca)
