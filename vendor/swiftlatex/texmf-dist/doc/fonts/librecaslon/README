This is the README for the librecaslon package, version
2019-10-26.

This package provides LaTeX, pdfLaTeX, XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX
support for the Libre Caslon family of fonts, designed by
Pablo Impallari.

To install this package on a TDS-compliant
TeX system download the file
"tex-archive"/install/fonts/librecaslon.tds.zip, where the
preferred URL for "tex-archive" is http://mirror.ctan.org.
Unzip the archive at the root of an appropriate texmf tree,
likely a personal or local tree. If necessary, update the
file-name database (e.g., texhash). Update the font-map
files by enabling the Map file LibreCaslon.map.

To use, add

\usepackage{librecaslon}

to the preamble of your document. This will activate Libre
Caslon Text as the main (serifed) text font. A bold italic
variant of Libre Caslon is not currently available; as a
stopgap, an artificially slanted version has been generated
and treated as if it were italic.

LuaLaTeX and xeLaTeX users who might prefer type1 fonts or who wish to
avoid fontspec may use the type1 option.

Options scaled=<number> or scale=<number> may be used to scale the
fonts.

The default figure style is proportional lining but options
osf (or oldstyle) and tf (or tabular) allow for use of
oldstyle and lining tabular figures, respectively.

Font encodings supported are OT1, T1, LY1 and TS1.

Macro \librecaslon selects the Libre Caslon Text family.
Macros \librecaslonLF, \librecaslonOsF and \librecaslonTLF
allow for local use of lining, oldstyle or tabular figures,
respectively. \textsu{...} and \textin{...} can be used for
superior (superscript) and inferior (subscript) figures,
respectively. Command \useosf switches the default figure
style to old-style figures; this is primarily for use after
calling a math package with lining figures as the default.

The original fonts (version 1.002) were obtained from

https://github.com/impallari/Libre-Caslon-Text

and are licensed under the SIL Open Font License (version
1.1); the text may be found in the doc directory. The type1
versions were generated by cfftot1. The support files were
created using autoinst and are licensed under the terms of
the LaTeX Project Public License. The maintainer of this
package is Bob Tennent (rdt at cs.queensu.ca)
