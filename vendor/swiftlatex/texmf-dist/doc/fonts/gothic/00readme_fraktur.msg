These are Fraktur (German Gothic) fonts generated by Daniel TAUPIN, using
the designs of font YFRAK by Yannis HARALAMBOUS in 1990. This is release 1.0.

To get the cm-layout, run metafont with cmfrak (yields font size 10pt).
To get the dc-layout, run metafont with dcfrak (yields font size 10pt).

cmfrak contains the accented letters at positions conform to dm* fonts.
dcfrak contains the accented letters at positions conform to dc* fonts.

Additions to Yannis Haralambous' work consists in shifting umlauted letters to
the Cork positions, after moving the ligatures to some free places.

Central Europe's.
