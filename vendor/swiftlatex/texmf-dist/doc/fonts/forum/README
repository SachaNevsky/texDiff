This is the README for the forum package, version
2019-12-17.

This package provides LaTeX, pdfLaTeX, XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX
support for the Forum font, designed by Denis Masharov.
Forum has antique, classic "Roman" proportions. It can
be used to set body texts and works well in titles and
headlines too. It is truly multilingual, with glyphs for
Central and Eastern Europe, Baltics, Cyrillic and Asian
Cyrillic communities. There is currently just a regular
weight and an artificially emboldened bold.

To install this package on a TDS-compliant
TeX system download the file
"tex-archive"/install/fonts/forum.tds.zip where the
preferred URL for "tex-archive" is http://mirrors.ctan.org.
Unzip the archive at the root of an appropriate texmf tree,
likely a personal or local tree. If necessary, update the
file-name database (e.g., texhash). Update the font-map
files by enabling the Map file forum.map.

To use, add

\usepackage{forum}

to the preamble of your document. This will activate
Forum as the main (serifed) text font.

LuaLaTeX and xeLaTeX users who might prefer type1 fonts or
who wish to avoid fontspec may use the type1 option.

Options scaled=<number> or scale=<number> may be used to
scale the fonts.

The only figure style is proportional lining.

Font encodings supported are OT1, T1, LY1, TS1 and T2A/B/C.

The original Truetype font was obtained from

https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Forum

and is licensed under the SIL Open Font License, version
1.1; the text may be found in the doc directory. The
bold and type1 versions was created using fontforge. The
support files were created using autoinst and otftotfm and
are licensed under the terms of the LaTeX Project Public
License. The maintainer of this package is Bob Tennent (rdt
at cs.queensu.ca)
