This is the README for the cormorantgaramond package,
version 3.601 (2020-01-06).

This package provides LaTeX, pdfLaTeX, XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX
support for the Cormorant Garamond family of fonts, designed by
Christian Thalman of Catharsis Fonts.

While this project was heavily inspired by Claude Garamont's
immortal legacy, Christian did not use any specific font as
a starting point or direct reference for the designs. Most
glyphs were drawn from scratch; when he needed guidance on
a specific character, he searched for the term Garamond and
skimmed through the results for a general impression.

The family includes light, regular, medium, semi-bold and
bold weights, with italics.

To install this package on a TDS-compliant
TeX system download the file
"tex-archive"/install/fonts/cormorantgaramond.tds.zip, 
where the preferred URL for "tex-archive" is
http://mirror.ctan.org. Unzip the archive at the root of
an appropriate texmf tree, likely a personal or local
tree. If necessary, update the file-name database (e.g.,
texhash). Update the font-map files by enabling the Map file
CormorantGaramond.map.

To use, add

\usepackage{CormorantGaramond}

to the preamble of your document. Options include:

oldstyle,osf    old-style figures
lining,nf,lf    lining figures

proportional,p  varying-width figures
tabular,t       fixed-width figures

The defaults are lining and proportional.

Small caps are available in all weights.

Use options

light, l        for light weight instead of regular
semibold, sb    for semi-bold weight instead of bold
medium          for medium weight instead of bold

Slanted variants are not supported; the italic variants will
be automatically substituted. Font encodings supported are
OT1, T1, TS1, LY1 and T2A/B/C.

Options scaled=<number> or scale=<number> may be used to adjust
fontsizes. The type1 option may be used by xelatex or lualatex users
who prefer to use type1 fonts or to avoid fontspec.

Commands \oldstylenums{...} and \liningnums{...} are defined to allow
for local use of old-style figures or lining figures, respectively.
Similarly, \tabularnums{...} and \proportionalnums{...} allow for local
use of monospaced or varying-width figures, respectively.

Superior numbers (for footnote markers) are available
using \sufigures or \textsu{...}. Inferior numbers (for
subscripts) are available using \infigures or \textinf{...}.

The original fonts are available at
https://fonts.google.com and are licensed
under the SIL Open Font License, (version 1.1); the text may
be found in the doc directory. 

The type1 versions were created using fontforge. The
support files were created using autoinst and otftotfm and
are licensed under the terms of the LaTeX Project Public
License. The maintainer of this package is Bob Tennent (rdt
