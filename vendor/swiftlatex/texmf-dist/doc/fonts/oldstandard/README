This is the README for the OldStandard package, version 2.5,
reease 2020-02-26.

This package provides the Old Standard family of fonts
designed by Alexey Kryukov and revised by Robert Alessi, 
in both OpenType and Type1 formats, with support for both 
traditional and modern LaTeX processors.

Old Standard reproduces a specific type of Modern
(classicist) style of serif typefaces, very commonly used in
various editions of the late 19th and early 20th century,
but almost completely abandoned later. However, this
lettertype still has at least two advantages:

  + it can be considered a good choice for typesetting
    scientific papers, especially in social and humanitarian
    sciences, as its specific features are closely
    associated in people's eyes with old books they learned
    on; 

 +  the most beautiful examples of Greek and Cyrillic
    lettertypes were all based on the classicist style,
    so for those scripts, "Modern" fonts are much more
    appropriate than any contemporary (e.g. Times-based)
    designs.

In comparison to previous releases of *Old Standard*, this release 
includes a bold italic, new letters and some corrections:

1. Small capitals for Roman, Greek and Cyrillic letters, in all three
   styles, Regular, Italic and Bold have been added. Small capitals,
   which were missing from *Old Standard*, were already in use a
   century ago in fine books which used font faces very similar to
   *Old Standard*. Typical use cases of small capitals were headers,
   current headings and in some books proper names.
2. The letter G with caron above, that is: Ǧ (`U+01E6`, uppercase) and
   ǧ (`U+01E7`, lowercase) has been added. It is the only character
   missing from *Old Standard* that is needed in some of the accepted
   standards of romanization of classical Arabic.[^2]
3. Additionally, this release corrects the `+ss06` feature provided by
   *Old Standard*. This feature is supposed to distinguish between
   regular and ‘curled’ beta (β/ϐ) and to print ‘curled’ beta
   (`U+03D0`) in medial position. This feature worked in most cases
   with the previous release of *Old Standard*. However, it failed if
   the beta is preceded by a vowel with an acute accent taken from the
   *Greek extended* Unicode block.

To install this package on a TDS-compliant
TeX system download the file
"tex-archive"/install/fonts/oldstandard.tds.zip where the
preferred URL for "tex-archive" is http://mirrors.ctan.org.
Unzip the archive at the root of an appropriate texmf tree,
likely a personal or local tree. If necessary, update the
file-name database (e.g., texhash). Update the font-map
files by enabling the Map file OldStandard.map.

To use, add

\usepackage{OldStandard}

to the preamble of your document. This will activate
OldStandard as the main (serifed) text font. Regular,
Italic, Bold and BoldItalic styles are available. Font
encodings supported are OT1, T1, TS1, LY1, LGR and T2A/B/C.
The only figure style is tabular-lining.

LuaLaTeX and xeLaTeX users may also use OldStandard.sty but
should read the oldstand-manual document for information
on taking advantage of OpenType features. If they prefer
type1 fonts or wish to avoid fontspec they may use the type1
option.

Options scaled=<number> or scale=<number> may be used to
scale the fonts.

The fonts are licensed under the SIL Open Font License,
version 1.1; the text may be found in the doc directory.
The type1 versions were created using cfftot1. The LaTeX
support files were created using autoinst and are licensed
under the terms of the LaTeX Project Public License.
The maintainers of this package are Bob Tennent (rdt at
cs.queensu.ca), Nikola Lecic and Robert Alessi.
