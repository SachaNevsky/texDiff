This is the README for the bitter package, version
2019-05-10.

This package provides LaTeX, pdfLaTeX, XeLaTeX
and LuaLaTeX support for the Bitter family of
fonts, designed by Sol Matas for Huerta Tipografica
(http://www.huertatipografica.com.ar). Bitter is a
contemporary slab-serif typeface for text. There are regular
and bold weights and an italic, but no bold italic.

To install this package on a TDS-compliant TeX system
download the file "tex-archive"/install/fonts/bitter.tds.zip
where the preferred URL for "tex-archive" is
http://mirrors.ctan.org. Unzip the archive at the root
of an appropriate texmf tree, likely a personal or local
tree. If necessary, update the file-name database (e.g.,
texhash). Update the font-map files by enabling the Map file
bitter.map.

To use, add

\usepackage{bitter}

to the preamble of your document. This will activate Bitter as
the main (serifed) text font. 

LuaLaTeX and xeLaTeX users who might prefer type1 fonts or who wish
to avoid fontspec may use the type1 option.

Options scaled=<number> or scale=<number> may be used to scale the
fonts.

The only figure style is tabular-lining.

Font encodings supported are OT1, T1, LY1, and TS1.

The original Truetype fonts were obtained from

https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bitter

and are licensed under the SIL Open Font License, 
version 1.1; the text may be found in the doc directory. 
The type1 versions were created using fontforge. The
support files were created using autoinst and otftotfm and
are licensed under the terms of the LaTeX Project Public
License. The maintainer of this package is Bob Tennent (rdt
at cs.queensu.ca)
