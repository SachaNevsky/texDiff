The XEPERSIAN-HM package
------------------------

Kashida feature in `xepersian' has problems with some fonts such as `HM Series'
fonts available at `https://dma8hm1334.bitbucket.io' and `X Series 2' fonts
available at `http://wiki.irmug.com/index.php/X_Series_2'. The `xepersian-hm'
package fixes these problems.

The file `texmf-dist/doc/xelatex/xepersian-hm/kashida-example.tex' can be used as
a simple example of the usage of the package.

Any comments or suggestions would be gratefully appreciated.
Please report any bugs or issues to `dma8hm1334@gmail.com'.

I will do my best to fix all the bugs you report, but, unfortunately,
time is a big hurdle to overcome; so, my apologies in advance for those
which I cannot make time to fix.
