Bibtex style 
munich.bst
****************

Munich.bst was created as a Bibtex style that complements the existing Bibtex
styles for name (year) citations. In most cases the popular Harvard Bibtex
style (http://www.tug.org/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/entries/
harvard-latex.html) or the Oxford Bibtex style (http://www.tug.org/
tex-archive/help/Catalogue/entries/oxford.html) lead to good results.
Yet I found them not entirely suitable to create a bibliography for a German/
continental Europe academic paper.

If your are looking for an alternative name (year) Bibtex style munich.bst might be just what 
you are looking for.
