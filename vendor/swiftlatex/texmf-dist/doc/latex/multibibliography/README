Conventional standards for bibliography styles entail a forced choice
between index and name/year citations and corresponding references.
We reject this false dichotomy, and describe a multibibliography,
comprising alphabetic, sequenced, and even chronological orderings of
references.  An extended inline citation format is also proposed to
integrate such heterogeneous styles, and is usable and useful even
without separate bibliographies.
