The PM-ISOmath package, version 1.0.04 of 2018
Original author: Claudio Beccari, 2017
LaTeX Project Public Licence LPPL v.1.3c (or later)

The PM-ISOmath name stands for "Poor Man ISO Math". In substance
 this package is a poor man solution to the task of typesetting 
 math fulfilling the ISO regulations "for physical sciences and 
 technology" (formerly regulations ISO 31/XI, now ISO\,80000). 
 These regulations refer mostly to the family, series and shape 
 of fonts to be used with symbols of various nature.

This package gets inspiration from the ISOmath package by Günter 
 Milde, but tries to get the same results without using any math 
 [font] groups (or families). As pdfLaTeX users may recall, this 
 typesetting program may see at maximum 16 math [font] groups (or 
 math font families); sometimes this number results in an error 
 that forbids the user to use the symbols s/he needs.

The trick used in this package consists in employing text fonts 
 within the \text command (defined by the amsmath package that,
 therefore, is a dependence  to which pm-isomath is subjected) and 
 chose text font families, series, and shapes to be used within 
 that command argument.

The commands are such as to fulfil some math requirements; for 
 example while in the scope of the \boldmath declaration, the 
 series is automatically set to bold without any user intervention. 
 The font size is automatically taken care by \text, so that fonts 
 have the correct size also while typesetting exponents or subscripts.

Nevertheless, through proper advanced command options, the user 
 remains the person principally responsible of using the right 
 font for the right symbol in a document that must fulfil the 
 ISO regulations.

This package is usable only with pdfLaTeX; LuaLaTeX and XeLaTeX 
 can access OpenType math fonts through the package unicode-math, 
 and with the "math-style=ISO" option they have the math switching 
 commands agree with the ISO regulations.

pdfLATeX users have available some packages to fulfil the ISO
 requirements; principally the ISOmath package that is subject 
 to a number of limitations due the the particular math environment 
 of the user, and libertinust1math that produces a complete set-up 
 with math fonts that match very well text fonts that are darker 
 than the standard default Computer Modern ones (including the 
 CM-super and the Latin Modern ones).

This package works very well with the Latin Modern fonts; in 
 practice in math mode it uses the same Latin text fonts, and 
 the corresponding families, series, and shapes of the LGR 
 encoded CBfonts; it may work also with the CM and the CM-super 
 fonts, but the original author never uses them, therefore he 
 cannot guarantee any suitable result.

For installation of this package, simply run the pm-isomath.dtx 
 through pdfLaTeX (and only pdfLaTeX); move the produced sty file 
 to the .../tex/latex/pm-isomath/ folder; if it does not exist, 
 create it; similarly move pm-isomath.dtx to .../source/latex/pm-isomath/ 
 and pm-isomath.pdf to .../doc/latex/pm-isomath/.
