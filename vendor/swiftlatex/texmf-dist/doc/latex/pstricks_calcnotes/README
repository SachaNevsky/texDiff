This package presents three applications of PSTricks for making LaTeX lecture notes in
Calculus.

Application 1: Drawing approximations to the area under a graph by rectangles.
Application 2: Drawing the vector field of an ordinary differential equation of order one.
               (The remarks on this application give a way of coloring arrows properly for a vector field.)
Application 3: Drawing partitions of a simply connected plane domain.
               (There is a modified version of this application: AppThreePDF.pdf or AppThreePS.ps.)
