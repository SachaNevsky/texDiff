 1. Package description
 ----------------------
 
 uni-wtal-lin is a citation style for the biblatex package. 
 It provides citations for linguistic studies according with 
 the institute for linguistics at the Bergische Universität 
 Wuppertal, Germany. The scheme is a authoryear style, based
 on the authoryear standard style.
 The rules for generating the bibliography are based on the
 guidelines of the institute and, in cases of inaccuracy, on
 the rules of the Unified style sheet for linguistics.
 In cases of doubt, I interpreted the rest of the rules.
 This creates the following dependence of priorities:

 Own interpretation > Germanistik Broschüre BUW > Unified 
 style sheet for linguistics.

 Although I called the style "uni-wtal-lin", it can of
 course be also used for other efforts.
 

 2. Installation and usage notes
 -------------------------------
 
 Just put the bbx and the cbx file into the directory of 
 your LaTeX project or add the contents into your preamble.

 The Style executes the following options by default:

   maxnames=2,
   maxbibnames=99,
   dashed=false,
   edsuper=true

 Use edsuper=false to deactivate the option of superscripted
 edition numbers.

 If you are a student of the Germanistik at the Uni Wuppertal,
 you might want to take a look at my example file that I
 designed to be comparable with the Germanistik brochure.
