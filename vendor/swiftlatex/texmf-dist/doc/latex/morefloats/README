1 INTRODUCTION
==============

The limit of unprocessed floats, 18, can be increased with this
morefloats package. Otherwise, \clear(double)page, h(!), H from the
float package, or \FloatBarrier from the picins package might help.

Note: The original main code of this package
(without \extrafloats from LaTeX 2015) was invented by
Don Hosek, Quixote, 1990/07/27 (Thanks!).
Maintenance has been taken over in September 2010 by H.-Martin M\"{u}nch.

2 DOWNLOAD
==========

`morefloats' is available on CTAN:
https://www.ctan.org/pkg/morefloats

Also a ZIP file is provided that contains the files:
the manual (morefloats.pdf), the example (morefloats-example.tex),
the compiled example (morefloats-example.pdf),
driver (morefloats.drv), morefloats.dtx,
installation file (morefloats.ins), 
the style file (morefloats.sty),
and this README, already sorted in a TDS tree:
http://mirrors.ctan.org/install/macros/latex/contrib/morefloats.tds.zip


3 INSTALLATION
==============

Installation with ZIP file in TDS format
----------------------------------------
The ZIP file `morefloats.tds.zip' contains the files
sorted in a TDS tree. Thus you can directly unpack the
ZIP file inside a TDS tree.
See https://www.ctan.org/TDS-guidelines for an explanation
of TDS.
Example:
  cd /...somewhere.../texmf
  unzip /...downloadpath.../morefloats.tds.zip
Do not forget to refresh the file name database of this
TDS tree.
Example:
  texhash /...somewhere.../texmf
(and check for old morefloats.sty at other locations in your
 TeX installation).

Manual installation
-------------------
a) Download the morefloats files from CTAN.
   If necessary, unpack them.
b) Check for old morefloats.sty at other locations in your
    TeX installation and delete them (or back them up,
    but in a way TeX does NOT find them automatically).
c) Generate the package and driver files:
     tex morefloats.dtx
d) Install the file `morefloats.sty' in your TDS tree:
     cp morefloats.sty TDS:tex/latex/morefloats/
   Replace `TDS:' by the prefix of your TDS tree
   (texmf directory).
e) Create the documentation, if necessary, e.g.
     pdflatex morefloats.dtx
     makeindex -s gind.ist morefloats.idx
     pdflatex morefloats.dtx
     makeindex -s gind.ist morefloats.idx
     pdflatex morefloats.dtx
f) Update the databases if necessary, e.g. for teTeX:
     mktexlsr .../texmf
g) Create the morefloats-example.pdf, if necessary, e.g.
     pdflatex morefloats-example.tex
     pdflatex morefloats-example.tex
     pdflatex morefloats-example.tex
h) Copy the documentation files to
   "TDS:doc/latex/morefloats/":
   README, morefloats.pdf, morefloats-example.tex,
   morefloats-example.pdf.


4 ADDITIONAL PACKAGES
=====================

morefloats itself loads the kvoptions package:
https://ctan.org/pkg/kvoptions
which again loads other packages
(see the result of the \listfiles command in the log-file
 of the example).
When an old LaTeX format is used, additionally the 
https://ctan.org/pkg/ifetex
package is used.


5 PACKAGE COMPATIBILITY
=======================

There are no known incompatibilities.

7 BUG REPORTS
==============

A bug report should contain:
* Comprehensive problem description. This includes error or
  warning messages.
* \errorcontextlines=\maxdimen can be added in the
  TeX code to get more information in TeX error messages.
* Minimal test file that shows the problem, but does not
  contain any unnecessary packages and code.
* Used drivers/programs.
* Version information about used packages and programs.
* If you are using LaTeX, then add "\listfiles". Then
  a list of version information is printed at the end
  of the LaTeX run.
* Please no other files than the minimal test file.
  The other files .log, .dvi, .ps, .pdf are seldom
  necessary, so send them only on request.
* Please .zip or .tar.gz your file(s) before sending them!

8 KNOWN PROBLEMS
=================

* If you request too many floats, (La)TeX will run out of
  memory. When testing, this happened when requesting
  more than 1570 (!) floats.
