This bundle comprises three packages:

    * The linguex package facilitates the formatting of linguist examples, automatically taking care of example numbering, indentations, indexed brackets, and the '*' in grammaticality judgments.
    * The linguho package facilitates making handouts from documents that use linguex for examples
    * The ps-trees package provides linguistic trees, building on the macros of tree-dvips , but overcoming some of the older package's shortcomings.
