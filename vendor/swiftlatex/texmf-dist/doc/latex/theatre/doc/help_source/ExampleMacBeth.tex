\rgdducan{What bloody man is that? He can report,\separvers{}As seemeth by his plight, of the revolt\separvers{}The newest state.}
\rptmalcolm{This is the sergeant\separvers{}Who like a good and hardy soldier fought\separvers{}'Gainst my captivity. Hail, brave friend!\separvers{}Say to the king the knowledge of the broil\separvers{}As thou didst leave it.}
\rptsergeant{Doubtful it stood;\separvers{}As two spent swimmers, that do cling together\separvers{}And choke their art. The merciless Macdonwald--\separvers{}Worthy to be a rebel, for to that\separvers{}The multiplying villanies of nature\separvers{}Do swarm upon him--from the western isles\separvers{}Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied;\separvers{}And fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,\separvers{}Show'd like a rebel's whore: but all's too weak:\separvers{}For brave Macbeth--well he deserves that name--\separvers{}Disdaining fortune, with his brandish'd steel,\separvers{}Which smoked with bloody execution,\separvers{}Like valour's minion carved out his passage\separvers{}Till he faced the slave;\separvers{}Which ne'er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him,\separvers{}Till he unseam'd him from the nave to the chaps,\separvers{}And fix'd his head upon our battlements.}
\rgdducan{O valiant cousin! worthy gentleman!}
\rptsergeant{As whence the sun 'gins his reflection\separvers{}Shipwrecking storms and direful thunders break,\separvers{}So from that spring whence comfort seem'd to come\separvers{}Discomfort swells. Mark, king of Scotland, mark:\separvers{}No sooner justice had with valour arm'd\separvers{}Compell'd these skipping kerns to trust their heels,\separvers{}But the Norweyan lord surveying vantage,\separvers{}With furbish'd arms and new supplies of men\separvers{}Began a fresh assault.}
\rgdducan{Dismay'd not this\separvers{}Our captains, Macbeth and Banquo?}
\rptsergeant{Yes;\separvers{}As sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion.\separvers{}If I say sooth, I must report they were\separvers{}As cannons overcharged with double cracks, so they\separvers{}Doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe:\separvers{}Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds,\separvers{}Or memorise another Golgotha,\separvers{}I cannot tell.\separvers{}But I am faint, my gashes cry for help.}
\rgdducan{So well thy words become thee as thy wounds;\separvers{}They smack of honour both. Go get him surgeons.}
\TheatreMvt{Exit Sergeant, attended}
\rgdducan{Who comes here?}
\TheatreMvt{Enter ROSS}
\rptmalcolm{The worthy thane of Ross.}
\rptlennox{What a haste looks through his eyes! So should he look\separvers{}That seems to speak things strange.}
\rptross{God save the king!}
\rgdducan{Whence camest thou, worthy thane?}
\rptross{From Fife, great king;\separvers{}Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky\separvers{}And fan our people cold. Norway himself,\separvers{}With terrible numbers,\separvers{}Assisted by that most disloyal traitor\separvers{}The thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict;\separvers{}Till that Bellona's bridegroom, lapp'd in proof,\separvers{}Confronted him with self-comparisons,\separvers{}Point against point rebellious, arm 'gainst arm.\separvers{}Curbing his lavish spirit: and, to conclude,\separvers{}The victory fell on us.}
\rgdducan{Great happiness!}
\rptross{That now\separvers{}Sweno, the Norways' king, craves composition:\separvers{}Nor would we deign him burial of his men\separvers{}Till he disbursed at Saint Colme's inch\separvers{}Ten thousand dollars to our general use.}
\rgdducan{No more that thane of Cawdor shall deceive\separvers{}Our bosom interest: go pronounce his present death,\separvers{}And with his former title greet Macbeth.}
\rptross{I'll see it done.}
\rgdducan{What he hath lost noble Macbeth hath won.}
