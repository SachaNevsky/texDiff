If you do not define all cards of a deck, then a lot of `missing card'
warnings will appear. Therefore most of the time it is better that warnings
are switched off. This is the default, but you can explicitly do that with
|\setdefaults{warn=off}|. It is also the default to produce \emph{error}
messages, which you can also switch off with |\setdefaults{err=off}|.
We recommend to have errors shown when you enter new diagrams. Please
observe how the |\smaller\smaller| command shrinked the diagram. We did
that to make all the warnings fit in the box. To avoid that all following
diagrams are also shrinked you must call |\gamefont{\bfseries\sffamily}|
again without the resizing. Calling |\resetfonts| has the same effect, but
would also influence the other fonts.
