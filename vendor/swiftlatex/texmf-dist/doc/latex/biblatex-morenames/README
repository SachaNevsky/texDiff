This package adds new fields of "name" type to the standard entry types of biblatex.
For example:
- maineditor, for a @collection, means the editor of @mvcollection, and not the editor of the @collection.
- bookineditor, for a @bookinbook, means the editor of the entry, and not, as the standard editor field, the editor of the volume in which the entry is contained. 

More new "name" fields could be added, if asked and needed.
