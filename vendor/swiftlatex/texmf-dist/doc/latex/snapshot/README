The snapshot package helps the owner of a LaTeX document
obtain a list of the external dependencies of the document, in a
form that can be embedded at the top of the document. To put it
another way, it provides a snapshot of the current processing
context of the document, insofar as it can be determined from
inside LaTeX.

Originally written by Michael J. Downes, the snapshot package
is currently maintained by the American Mathematical Society.
