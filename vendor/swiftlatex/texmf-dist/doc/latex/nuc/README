nuc.sty is provided by Neal Davis (davis68@illinois.edu).  This package provides
automatic notation for nuclear isotopes.  Isotopes which have Z with more digits
than A require special spacing to appear properly.  nuc.sty is released under
the LaTeX Project Public License.

This is an early draft (v.0.1) of this package.

It is invoked in the usual way,
    \usepackage{nuc}
and each element and isotope is indicated by \(element name){(element weight)}.
For instance,
    \Pa{231}
    \O{18}
    \H{3}

It appears that under certain circumstances, \protect may be required prior to
invoking the element (i.e., \protect\U{235}).

This package does not currently support omission of the atomic number subscript,
although that is planned for the next version.
