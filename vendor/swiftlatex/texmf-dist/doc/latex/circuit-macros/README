  This is a set of macros for drawing high-quality line diagrams to
  include in LaTeX, web, or similar documents, with support for SVG
  (including Inkscape) and other formats.  Fundamental electric circuit
  elements and basic logic gates based on IEEE and European standards are
  included with several tools and examples of other types of diagrams.
  Elements can be scaled or drawn in any orientation and are easy
  to modify.  The advantages and disadvantages of such a system in its
  basic form are similar to those of TeX itself, which is macro-based and
  non-WYSIWYG; however, graphical interfaces are available for specific
  operating systems as mentioned below.

  The macros are to be processed by an m4 macro processor, and evaluate to
  drawing commands in the pic "little language," which is easy to read and
  learn. The diagram is then automatically translated into TiKZ, PSTricks,
  or other formats for processing by LaTeX or other applications. Pic
  is well suited to line drawings requiring parametric or conditional
  components, fine adjustment, geometric calculations, repetition, or
  recursion.  Arbitrary text for formatting by LaTeX can be included.
  Free interpreters for m4 and pic are readily available.

REQUIRED SOFTWARE:
Preferred setup:
  GNU m4, dpic (see below), LaTeX, PSTricks, dvips
  or
  m4, dpic, LaTeX or PDFLaTeX, TikZ-PGF

  The GNU m4 macro processor is assumed, and a small number of macros
  require GNU m4 features. Other versions of m4 will work with most macros.

  The dpic interpreter can translate pic input into several forms,
  typically a .tex file for processing by latex with pgf/Tikz or PSTicks.

Alternative:
  m4, GNU pic (gpic), TeX or LaTeX, and a driver recognizing tpic specials
   (eg dvips)

  The GNU pic interpreter with option -t produces tpic special commands.

Also possible for some diagrams:
  m4 and dpic with output in the following formats:
    LaTeX graphics or LaTeX eepic (for simple diagrams), mfpic, xfig,
    MetaPost, SVG, PDF, or Postscript.

USAGE
  First-time users should read the Quick Start section of Circuit_macros.pdf.

  The following describes the most common basic usage to produce tikz
  or pstricks graphics for LaTeX; see below for integration with other
  tools and production of other formats. You probably should try out
  the basic usage before integrating the macros with sophisticated
  system-dependent tools. When developing your own diagrams, refer to
  the macro descriptions in the List of Macros section of Circuit_macros.pdf.

  Suppose that  a source file, cct.m4 say, has been created and the top
  two lines are
  .PS
  cct_init
  ...

  The file is processed by feeding a configuration file followed by the
  diagram source to m4, and routing the output to dpic.  If you have set
  the M4PATH environment variable as described in the INSTAllATION
  instructions, the command for Tikz processing is

    m4 pgf.m4 cct.m4 | dpic -g > cct.tex

  NOTE: The order in which the files are given to m4 is important.
  A configuration file (pgf.m4 in this example) must ALWAYS appear first.

  If you have not set the M4PATH environmental variable then the command is

    m4 -I <path> pgf.m4 cct.m4 | dpic -g > cct.tex

  where <path> is the absolute path to the directory containing the library
  macros.

  If the first line of cct.m4 is
  include(pgf.m4)
  and M4PATH is defined, then this command can be simplified to

    m4 cct.m4 | dpic -g > cct.tex

  In each case, the resulting file cct.tex is normally inserted into
  a document to be processed by LaTeX.  The -g option of dpic produces
  Tikz-pgf graphics commands in cct.tex so the LaTeX document must have
  \usepackage{tikz} in the preamble.

  To produce postscript output, the LaTeX preamble must contain
  \usepackage{pstricks}, pstricks.m4 is read instead of pgf.m4, and the dpic
  option is -p, so the command is

    m4 pstricks.m4 cct.m4 | dpic -p > cct.tex

  or, if include(pstricks.m4) is the first line of cct.m4,

    m4 cct.m4 | dpic -p > cct.tex

  Read Section 2 of the manual to see how to process the diagram source
  from within the main .tex source file.

  To use the GNU gpic processor (called pic on some systems) instead of dpic,
  the command is

    m4 gpic.m4 cct.m4 | gpic -t > cct.tex

  with the -I <path> option added if M4PATH has not been defined.

INSTALLATION:
  1.  Decide where you will be installing the .m4 library files. In
      principle, they can go anywhere; for example, $HOME/Circuit_macros,
      c:\localtexmf\Circuit_macros, /usr/local/share/Circuit_macros,
      or ~/texmf/tex/latex/Circuit_macros.  Copy the files from the
      top-level directory of the distribution to the installation
      directory, or simply expand the .tar.gz or .zip distribution file
      and rename the result to create the installation directory, which
      will then include the doc and examples subdirectories.

  2.  Copy boxdims.sty (see Section 9 of the manual) from the top
      distribution directory to where LaTeX will find it; directory
      ~/texmf/tex/latex/boxdims for example, and refresh the LaTeX
      filename database (the exact command depends on your LaTeX
      distribution and may not be necessary).

  3.  Define the environment variable M4PATH to point to the installation
      directory determined in Step 1. For the bash shell, for
      example, add the following to your .bashrc file:
      export M4PATH='.:~/texmf/tex/latex/Circuit_macros:'
      but modify the path to the installation directory as necessary.

  4.  This is optional. For historical reasons, the default configuration file
      as distributed is gpic.m4. You can change it to pgf.m4 or pstricks.m4
      for use with dpic by editing the include command near the top of
      libgen.m4.  To do this automatically, go to the installation directory
      and type
        "make pgfdefault" to set the default processor to dpic with Tikz pgf
        "make psdefault"  to set the default processor to dpic with PSTricks
        "make gpicdefault" to restore gpic as the default.

  In case of difficulty, go to the examples directory, look at debug1.tex
  and debug2.m4, and follow instructions.

WORKFLOW: The basic commands given above suffice for documents of moderate
  size and complexity; otherwise, a "make" facility or equivalent should be
  used or, for modest documents, diagram processing can be controlled from
  within the tex document source as described in the manual. For near-immediate
  viewing, three windows can be kept open: one in which to edit the source, one
  to process the source and produce postscript or pdf, and GSview 5.0, which
  updates when clicked. The Okular viewer also re-loads automatically.

  Special-purpose editors and GUI-based project tools such as TeXnicCenter
  can also be employed, or a scripting language can automate the steps as
  done by Latexmk or several other similar tools; see, for example,
  http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/64/tools-for-automating-document-compilation

  NOTE: One of the configuration files (gpic.m4, pstricks.m4, pgf.m4,
  pdf.m4, postscript.m4, psfrag.m4, mpost.m4, mfpic.m4, svg.m4, or
  xfig.m4) must be read by m4 before (or at the beginning of) the diagram
  source file, depending on the required form of pic output. Otherwise,
  libgen.m4 can be read first but it will invoke the default configuration
  file, which is gpic.m4 in the distribution unless it has been changed
  during installation.

TESTING:
  To test your installation, go to the examples directory (or copy the
  files Makefile, tst.tex, and any .m4 sources you might like to test
  to a working directory) and create a test circuit in the
  file test.m4.  Copy ex01.m4, for example, or quick.m4 from the doc
  directory into test.m4.

  On a system with a "make" facility, first check the definitions at
  the top of the Makefile, and then type "make tst1" to produce the
  file tst.ps.  If the source requires processing twice, type "make
  tst" instead.  To process one of the example .m4 files in the
  examples directory, simply type "make name.ps" to process name.m4.
  If these tests work to your satisfaction, try typing simply "make" to
  produce examples.ps.  To test .pdf files, go to the pgf directory,
  copy name.m4 there, and type either "make name.ps" or "make name.pdf"
  to test the file under pdflatex and TikZ PGF.

  The .m4 files in the examples directory can serve as models for your
  diagrams but keep in mind that some of them contain details that allow
  the source to be used with a variety of postprocessors. Sticking to one
  postprocessor such as tikz or PStricks allows for the simplest source.
  You might also wish to browse some of the included files that are not
  used to make examples.ps.

  A few of the sources in the examples directory are copies of files
  from the doc directory.  They are duplicated to provide flexibility
  of directory structure and independency of sources.

  No "make" facility?  You have to test by hand (but see below for
  diagram production software).  Copy a test file as above into
  test.m4.  Assuming you have dpic installed, type the following:

  m4 -I <path> pstricks.m4 test.m4 > test.pic
  dpic -p test.pic > test.tex
  latex tst
  dvips tst -o tst.ps

  M4 is widely available on Unix systems.  PC source and executables are
  also available: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/m4.htm
  A large set of Unix-like Windows tools, including m4, is available via
  http://www.cygwin.com/
  DJGPP versions are available as m4-NNb.zip (where NN is the current
  release number) on web archives and at
  http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/dl/ofc/dlfiles.cgi/current/v2gnu/

  There are several sources of hints on m4 usage; some places to look are
  http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/m4.htm  (m4 for Windows)
  http://www.gnu.org/software/m4/manual/   (GNU m4 manual)
  https://mbreen.com/m4.html    (m4 by example)
  https://www.seindal.dk/rene/gnu/    (development site)
  The m4 (computer language) article in Wikipedia gives a concise overview.
  An academic discussion of the language can be found in
  http://www.cs.stir.ac.uk/~kjt/research/pdf/expl-m4.pdf.
  The GNU Autoconf manual contains a chapter on M4 programming:
  http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/manual/index.html
  (Do not read this manual first). Autoconf uses quote characters [ and ]
  instead of the default ` and ' which work well with the pic language.

  showing how to use Circuit_macros with his setup is at

  Gpic is part of the GNU groff distribution, for which the source
  and documentation is available from http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/groff/
  but there are mirror sites as well. The original AT&T pic manual
  can be obtained at http://doc.cat-v.org/unix/v10/10thEdMan/pic.pdf
  A more extensive manual is found in the documentation that comes with
  GNU pic, which is typically installed as gpic. A pdf copy is included
  with the dpic distribution and a version can be found on the web at
  http://www.kohala.com/start/troff/gpic.raymond.ps

DPIC:
  Dpic is not included here you say?  If you want to try the LaTeX
  picture objects, mfpic, PSTricks, TikZ-PGF, MetaPost, xfig, SVG, PDF,
  or Postscript output provided by dpic, there are at least three possibilities:
  Some Linux distributions will install dpic automatically, the current
  (free) C source and Windows executable can be obtaied from
  http://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~aplevich/dpic/
  and a git repository containing complete source is at
  https://gitlab.com/aplevich/dpic
  The source can be found in a number of repositories but many contain
  older versions, see https://repology.org/project/dpic/badges
  The best advice is to obtain the newest version.

  The dpic distribution includes a manual dpic-doc.pdf containing a summary
  of the pic language and descriptions of features unique to dpic.

EXAMPLES AND INTEGRATION WITH OTHER TOOLS:
  A set of examples is included in this distribution, showing electric
  circuits, block diagrams, flow charts, signal-flow graphs, basic use
  of colour and fill, and other applications.

  Read the manual Circuit_macros.pdf and view or print the file
  examples.ps in the examples directory.  There are a few other source
  files in the examples directory that are not shown in examples.pdf.
  For the possibly unstable development version of these macros, try
  http://ece.uwaterloo.ca/~aplevich/Circuit_macros/

  The examples directory Makefile automates the generation of .ps, .eps,
  .png, and .pdf files for individual diagrams.  Subdirectories of the
  examples directory are for testing metafont, metapost, pgf, psfrag,
  pdf, and xfig examples.

  Installation and usage of the macros have evolved a little since the
  beginning so archived instructions on the net may be slightly more
  complicated than currently necessary.  However, a number of people
  have developed tools that simplify workflow for their circumstances,
  which are beyond the scope of this distribution.

  A set of examples and hints intended for his colleagues has been
  produced by Alan Robert Clark at http://ytdp.ee.wits.ac.za/cct.html

  A Python-based GUI called PyCirkuit is at
  https://pypi.org/project/pycirkuit/ and
  https://github.com/orestesmas/pycirkuit.
  For an introduction, look at the FOSDEM video by Orestes Mas:
  https://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/fosdem/2020/H.2215/pycirkuit.webm

  A KDE interface created by Matteo Agostinelli can be found at
  http://wwwu.uni-klu.ac.at/magostin/cirkuit.html.  A git repository
  of a newer version of cirkuit by Andrew G. for Linux is at
  https://github.com/ag-ckt/cirkuit/tree/V0.5.0. Because of changes
  in library dependencies, there is uncertainty about installation
  possibilities.

  The examples in the current distribution include some flowchart elements
  in Flow.m4.  For a pic-only version that does not require m4, look at
  http://web.ing.puc.cl/~mtorrest/downloads.htm#TeX

  Pic dates from the 1980s and was first developed as a preprocessor for
  the *roff family of Unix word processors.  Some additional libraries such
  as chem (for chemical structures) and dformat (for data structures) are
  still viable.

  Pic macros for drawing graphs are described at
  http://www.math.uiuc.edu/~west/gpic.html
  After minor adaptation to dpic syntax, many of them can be simplified.

  A collection of pic resources and related material is available at
  http://www.kohala.com/start/troff/troff.html In particular, W. Richard
  Stevens illustrated his books on Unix and TCP/IP using pic macros. Some
  of the sources found there need minor tuning to work under dpic.

MetaPost examples:  Go to the examples/mpost directory.  Check the
  Makefile as described in the README file, type "make", and stand well back.

Postscript with embedded psfrag strings:
  Type "make" in the examples/psfrag directory to process examples
  using dpic -f for creating .eps files with embedded psfrag strings.

Postscript, CorelDraw, Adobe Illustrator:
  Circuits and other diagrams not requiring LaTeX-formatted text can be
  processed through m4 and dpic -r to produce encapsulated Postscript
  output. This output can also be imported into CorelDraw or Adobe
  Illustrator.  However, Postscript is not a word processor, so any
  LaTeX formatting instructions in the source are not obeyed. These programs
  also import svg output produced by dpic -v.

SVG output, Inkscape:
  Dpic -v produces svg output.  If the result is to be directly
  inserted into html, then as for Postscript output, the diagram source
  file has to be adapted to remove any LaTeX formatting. The configuration
  file svg.m4 contains macros that can assist.

  If SVG is the ultimate goal, then it may be advisable to use the tool
  dvisvgm to convert dvi to svg. An alternative on some systems is to
  produce pdf and then use pdf2svg, since the font selection and formatting
  problems associated with direct production of svg are eliminated.

  SVG is the native file format for the Inkscape graphics editor.
  Therefore, elements defined by these macros can be output by dpic -v
  in svg format for later manipulation by Inkscape.  A basic palette
  of circuit elements for importing into Inkscape is found in
  examples/svg/paletteSVG.m4.  In the svg subdirectory, type
  "make paletteSVG.svg", read the resulting file into Inkscape, and then
  ungroup the elements as desired. You would probably wish to add to or
  customize these elements for extensive use.

  Recent Inkscape versions can export graphics to eps or pdf format
  and text to tex format, so that labels can be formatted by LaTeX and
  overlaid on the graphics file. This process allows the use of Inkscape
  to place and embellish circuit elements.

Metafont:
  The file examples/mf/cct.mf is a Metafont source for a few variants of
  the basic elements, produced using the mfpic output of dpic.  It may
  be of interest to persons who cannot otherwise implement the macros.
  To see the elements (assuming a typical installation), type "make"
  in the mf directory.

Xfig:
  The file examples/xfig/xfiglib.fig contains circuit elements in xfig
  3.2 format produced by dpic.  The file is a prototype because many
  more elements could be included.  Logic gates often have many labels,
  and xfig is not a word processor, so some fine tuning of labels is in
  order.  Translation between languages always involves a loss of
  information and idiom, but Xfig can store diagrams in pic format, so
  it is possible to alternate between xfig and dpic.

LIBRARIES:
  The file libgen.m4 contains general-purpose macros and is read
  automatically by other libraries.  The file libcct.m4 defines basic
  circuit elements.  Binary logic-circuit elements are in liblog.m4.
  Macros for drawing 3D projections are in lib3D.m4, and some macros
  for drawing double-line arrows are in darrow.m4. The file dpictools.pic
  contains pic macros and is read automatically by some of the examples.

MODIFICATIONS:
  Macros such as these inevitably will be modified to suit individual
  needs and taste.  They continue to evolve in my own library as I use
  them and as others send comments.  No such collection can hope to
  include all possible circuit-related symbols, so you will probably
  find yourself writing your own macros or adapting some of these.  Be
  careful to rename modified macros to avoid confusion.  The learning
  curve compares well to other packages, but there is no trivially easy
  way to produce high-quality graphics.

Feel free to contact me with comments or questions.  I have retired
from full-time work but continue the hobby of maintaining these files.
I may now be able to spend more time on individual requests but I may
not reply instantly to email.
