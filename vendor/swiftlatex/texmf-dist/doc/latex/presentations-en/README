All files are prepaired for the book production,
the reason why they have lines like

\documentclass[]{exaarticle}
\setlength\textwidth{352.81416pt}
\setlength\parindent{0pt}
[...]
%\StartShownPreambleCommands
[...]
%\StopShownPreambleCommands
[..]

you can simply replace the documentclass to article and delete
the \setlength lines. However, all used example document classes
are also present in this directory, you can use that ones if
you like.

run all *.ltx2, *.ltx,  and *.ltxb with pdflatex. 
run all *.ltxbps and *.ltxpd with latex->dvips->ps2pdf
