\begin{document}
\begin{frame}{Negative example}
\begin{itemize}
 \item Make the font too large rather than too small. For example, don't use this {\tiny
    font size}; nobody in the back row will be able to read it even if they try.
 \item Have at most ten lines per slide. A slide with just a single line can
    also make sense.
 \item Allow \emph{one} line to show \emph{each} fact.
 \item Don't \emph{fill} slides with text to save space.
  \item Use white space as a means of layout.
  \item Give clear separation between the slide title and slide text.
  \item Have at most one subtitle.
\end{itemize}
