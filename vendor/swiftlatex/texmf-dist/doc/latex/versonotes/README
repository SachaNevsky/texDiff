Package versonotes
==================

Version 0.4, 2019 July 6

This package allows you to place notes on the verso pages of an
otherwise single-sided document.

If, in the run of text, you include a call to the macro
`\versonote{This is a remark}`, then that text will be placed on the
opposite (ie, ‘verso’) page, lined up with the macro call.

You can see a sample of how to use the package, and its results, in
sample.tex and sample.pdf.

The source is at [bitbucket][bitbucket],
and the package is distributed on CTAN in
[macros/latex/contrib/versonotes/][ctan]
