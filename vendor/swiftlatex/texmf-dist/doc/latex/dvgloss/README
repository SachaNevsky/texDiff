README for dvgloss 0.1

DESCRIPTION
===========
Extensible macros for setting interlinear glossed text --- useful,
for instance, for typing linguistics papers.  The operative word here is
"exstensible": few features are built in, but some flexible and powerful
facilities are included for adding your own.

FILES AND INSTALLATION
======================
The main files here are these two, which should be installed
in the usual way:

    dvgloss.dtx

There's also a .sty file and a pre-extracted documentation file:
    dvgloss.sty
    dvgloss.pdf

And then there's this very README file, whose contents I dare not start
describing for fear of infinite recursion:
