Delimseasy  2.0
===============

Changes to the package since Version 1.0:
   Added more delimeters (notably for binomial coefficients)
   Added delimiters for Valentine's Day
   Added a "D" version for those who like LaTeX's \left...\right construct but are tired of typing and editing those pairs.
   Revised Manual

This package contains the following files:

README2.0 - this document

delimseasyMan.pdf - the pdf version of the manual

delimseasyMan.tex - LaTeX source of the preceding; includes examples that are commented out

delimseasy.sty - the delims package

delimseasy is a package to make it simple and fast to change the size of delimiters and their blackness. Further information is in delimseasyMan.
