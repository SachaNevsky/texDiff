turnstile
  This style was based on article.cls to be used for typesetting
  articles. Among other uses, the turnstile sign is used by logicians
  for denoting a consequence relation, related to a given logic,
  between a collection of formulas and a formula. This package aims to
  issue the turnstile sign in many ways, and is capable of
  putting labels below and above it.

INSTALLATION (OF THE LATEX PACKAGE AND THE METAFONT SOURCE FILES)
  The installation procedure is described in the documentation, but
  you can also follow these steps.

  1. Download the files turnsilte-en\turnstile-en.ins and 
	 turnsilte-en\turnstile-en.dtx to a preferably
     empty directory. If you intend to keep the documentation, you'd
     better create a suitable directory and put the files there right
     now
  2. Start a shell where you can enter commands from the keyboard
  3. Go to the directory where you did put the files turnstile-en.dtx
     and turnstile-en.ins
  4. Run the command
       pdflatex turnstile-en.ins
     You will obtain the turnstile-en.sty
  5. Run the command
       pdflatex turnstile-en.dtx
     to produce the documentation and test the installation.
     Run it one more time to resolve the references, before
     you view it
