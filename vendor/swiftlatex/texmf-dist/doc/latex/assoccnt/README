The package assoccnt provides a way of associating counters to an 
existing driver counter, such incrementing the driver counter will increase
the associated counters as well. This package can be regarded as a supplement
to the totcount package by Vasileios Koutavas (http://www.ctan.org/pkg/totcount), but
can be used without it too.

This version provides

-- A third bug fix in `assoccnt` in conjunction with the calc package. 
-- Note: calc and assoccnt might work together but it can't guaranteed this will be the case and correct values are generated!
-- Some improved documentation

Note: This is perhaps the last version before a complete rewrite with `expl3` and LaTeX 3 - features will take place.
