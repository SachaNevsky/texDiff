Purpose:
 The mathcommand package provides functionalities for defining macros:
  - that have different behaviors depending on whether in math or text mode,
  - absorb Primes, Indices, Exponents (PIE) following LaTeX notations and
    have them as extra parameters usable in the code.
 The primary objective of this code is to be used together with the knowledge
 package for a proper handling of mathematical notations.

Install:
 It is sufficient to have the file mathcommand.sty accessible by LaTeX.
 It can be produced by `make mathcommand.sty' if necessary.
 The documentation is in the file mathcommand.pdf.

Content of the file mathcommand-ctan.zip:
 - README.md: this file generated while compiling mathcommand.ins,
 - mathcommand.sty: the package file (generated using knowledge.ins)
 - mathcommand.pdf: the user documentation (generated by compiling
   mathcommand.dtx)
 - makefile: the makefile. Use 'make all' to generate mathcommand.sty
   and knowledge.pdf. It can also: clean the directory, make zip
   version of the sources, or ready for CTAN.
 - mathcommand.ins: is the file generating mathcommand.sty and
   README.md from mathcommand.dtx (using docstrip).
