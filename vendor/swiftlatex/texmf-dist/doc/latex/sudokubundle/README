    To install the sudoku bundle:
o run: latex sudokubundle.ins (which will generate printsudoku.sty, 
       solvesudoku.sty and createsudoku.sty, and also somesudoku.tex)
o Move the .sty files to a location where LaTeX will find them (for more
   information on this see the FAQ).
o Run LaTeX on somesudoku.tex to typeset a collection of puzzles, plus
   their answers. Be aware that this will lead to a large number of small
   *.sud and *.ans files being created.

    To generate a second copy of the manual (which is already supplied as a PDF file):
o run: latex *.dtx
o (for an index run: makeindex -s gind.ist *.idx)
o run: latex *.dtx
o Print *.dvi for a hardcopy of the package manual
