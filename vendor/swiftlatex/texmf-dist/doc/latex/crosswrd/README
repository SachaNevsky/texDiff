Introduction
============

This distribution contains the crosswrd package by Brian Hamilton
Kelly updated to run with LaTeX2e the standard LaTeX distribution,
and extended in several ways, one of which Brian himself envisaged
but did not live to complete.  Brian died on 15th September 2005.

Frank Mittelbach's comments and instructions (slightly updated) 
follow after the hline.

I added support for several new features, including barred grids,
mixed barred/blocked grids, rectangular grids, automatic clue number
checking and more, and composed a hard cryptic in the Azed/Mephisto
style demonstrating those.

For the next few months I am willing to support the package.

Enjoy!

PS If you can solve the hard thematic puzzle, let me know.  I'd like
to add the names of the first few solvers to this README.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

I did change a bit of the coding to allow typesetting an unlimited
number of crosswords and also added two new commands

\DOWNtext and \ACROSStext 

that contain the heading texts for the clues. Thus this will allow you
to use the macros in a language environment other than English.
