1. Abstract
--------------------------

There are a lot of packages for typesetting units in LaTeX2e.
Some define macros to typeset a lot of units but do not suit 
to the actual font settings, some make the characters needed
available but do not predefine any unit.
  This package tries to comply with both requirements. It 
predefines common units, defines an easy to use interface to 
define new units and changes the output concerning to the
surrounding font settings.


2. Contents of the package
--------------------------

    unitsdef.dtx
    unitsdef.ins
    README.1st (this file)
    defedunits.tex
    defedpraef.tex
    unitsdef.pdf
    ampabbrv.cfg  
    freqabbr.cfg  
    molabbrv.cfg  
    volabbrv.cfg  
    weigabbr.cfg
    enerabbr.cfg  
    lengabbr.cfg  
    timeabbr.cfg  
    voltabbr.cfg



3. Installation
--------------------------

  - Run unitsdef.ins through latex to produce the packages style
    file. 

  - If you want to produce the documentation by yourself:
    Run unitsdef.dtx through latex twice, run

      makeindex -s gglo.ist -o unitsdef.gls unitsdef.glo 
    
    to produce the list of changes and 

      makeindex -s gind.ist unitsdef
    
    and run unitsdef.dtx through latex again.


  - If in your TDS already proper directories exist you should be able
    to skip the next two steps

    - Move the resulting .sty file to where latex finds it. On a TDS
      compliant system this should be (substitute $TEXMF with your
      texmf directory):

        $TEXMF/tex/latex/unitsdef/

    - Move all files from the config directory to a place where latex 
      finds them.
		
	$TEXMF/tex/latex/unitsdef/config/	

    - Move the documentation (unitsdef.pdf, if you haven't produced
      your own copy in a different format) to a place where latex will
      find it, usually, in a TDS compliant system:

        $TEXMF/doc/unitsdef

  - If you like to move the source files (.dtx, .ins and .tex) in a
    source directory of your system.

  - Update your filename database. How to do this depends on your
    distribution.
