 1. Package description
 ----------------------
 
 uni-wtal-ger is a citation style for the biblatex package. 
 It provides citations for literary studies according with 
 the faculty of humanities at the Bergische Universität 
 Wuppertal, Germany. The scheme is a fullcite for the first 
 citation and 'Author, Shorttitle, page number' and ibid
 for later citations. Some details vary to Wuppertal, since
 I thought them being not fully consistent. For further
 details, see the brochure "Germanistik in Wuppertal",
 available at the Universität Wuppertal, and the detailled
 example file germanistik.*.

 Although I called the style "uni-wtal-ger", it can of
 course be also used for other efforts.
 
 This package depends on the style authortitle-dw (c) by
 Dominik Waßenhoven.

 So authortitle-dw has to be installed, too!

 Visit http://biblatex.dominik-wassenhoven.de/ for it.


 2. Installation and usage notes
 -------------------------------
 
 Just put the bbx and the cbx file into the directory of 
 your LaTeX project or add the contents into your preamble.

 The Style executes the following options by default:

   firstfull=true,
   journalnumber=afteryear,
   ibidpage=true,
   idembibformat=dash,
   maxnames=2,
   xref=true,
   bibwarn=false

 If you are a student of the Germanistik at the Uni Wuppertal,
 you might want to take a look at my example file that I
 designed to be comparable with the Germanistik brochure.
