RRGtrees
A set of LaTeX macros that makes it easy to produce linguistic tree
diagrams suitable for Role and Reference Grammar (RRG). This package allows the
construction of trees with crossing lines, as is required by some languages
in this theory. 
There is no known limit on number of tree nodes or levels.

Requires the pst-node and pst-tree LaTeX packages.

The package also contains some macros useful for typsetting certain
other aspects of an RRG-based language write-up.

PDF files may be created via ps2pdf (ghostscript) or similar converter,
but not via pdflatex.
