This is the file README for synproof.sty.  You'll find complete documentation in synproof-doc.pdf

This package provides simple commands to draw syntactic proofs (derivations) in
modern logic. Each step of the derivation is a numbered line with the operation
used to derive it, and assumptions are represented as lines down to their conclusions
(as in the Gamut books). The derivation's appearance can be modified easily. 

Required packages (usually available on any LaTeX distribution): 
- ifthen.sty
- pstricks.sty
- pst-node.sty
- keyval.sty

Licensing of this package is covered by LPPL.
