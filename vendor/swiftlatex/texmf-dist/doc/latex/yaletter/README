This work consists of the files yaletter.ins and
yaletter.dtx, along with derived files yaletter.cls and
yaletter.pdf.

The yaletter class provides extremely configurable macros
for typesetting letters in any conceivable style.  It
provides facilities for maintaining easily-accessible
databases of letterheads and addresses for repeat use.  It
further provides easy macros for envelopes and for label
sheets.  Finally, it provides some nice defaults for a few
of the more common styles and sizes.

This class should run properly on any reasonably up-to-date
and operational LaTeX system.
