1 INTRODUCTION
==============

This package puts the labels LastPage (\AtEndDocument) and
VeryLastPage (\AfterLastShipout) into the .aux file,
allowing the user to refer to the (very) last page of a
document. This might be particularly useful in places like
headers or footers.
When more than one page numbering scheme is used, these
references do not give the total number of pages. For this
case the label LastPages is introduced. Additionally, at the
last page of each page numbering scheme a label
pagesLTS.<numbering scheme> is placed, where
<numbering scheme> is e. g. arabic, roman, Roman, alph, or
Alph. For fnsymbol please use
\lastpageref{pagesLTS.fnsymbol} instead of
\pageref{pagesLTS.fnsymbol}. When the same numbering scheme
is used twice, the page numbers are either reset to one or
continued automatically, depending on the option given when
the package is called. The command \theCurrentPage prints
the current total/absolute page number - in contrast to
\thepage, which gives only the page name in the current page
numbering scheme. \theCurrentPageLocal gives the current
number of pages in the current page numbering scheme.
\thepage and \theCurrentPageLocal are different e. g. when
\addtocounter{pageg}{...} or \setcounter{page}{...} were
used.
At the first page of the document a label pagesLTS.0 is
created. This label can be referred to, too. Further labels
are provided for special cases.
The alphalph package is supported, i. e. page numbers alph
or Alph > 26 and fnyambol > 9 can be used (with according
options set). Even zero and negative page numbers can be
used with arabic, alph, Alph, roman, Roman, and fnsymbol
page numbering (with alphalph package and according
options).
\pageref* and \pageref*, for using hyperref but suppressing
links, are supported.

2 DOWNLOAD
==========

`pageslts' is available on CTAN:
https://www.ctan.org/pkg/pageslts

Also a ZIP file is provided that contains the files:
the manual (pageslts.pdf), the example (pageslts-example.tex),
the compiled example (pageslts-example.pdf), 
driver (pageslts.drv), pageslts.dtx,
installation file (pageslts.ins), 
the style file (pageslts.sty),
and this README, already sorted in a TDS tree:
http://mirrors.ctan.org/install/macros/latex/contrib/pageslts.tds.zip


3 INSTALLATION
==============

Installation with ZIP file in TDS format
----------------------------------------
The ZIP file `pageslts.tds.zip' contains the files
sorted in a TDS tree. Thus you can directly unpack the
ZIP file inside a TDS tree.
See https://www.ctan.org/TDS-guidelines for an explanation
of TDS.
Example:
  cd /...somewhere.../texmf
  unzip /...downloadpath.../pageslts.tds.zip
Do not forget to refresh the file name database of this
TDS tree.
Example:
  texhash /...somewhere.../texmf

Manual installation
-------------------
a) Download the pageslts files from CTAN.
   If necessary, unpack them.
b) Check for old `pagesLTS.sty' at other locations in your
    TeX installation and delete them (or back them up,
    but in a way TeX does NOT find them automatically).
c) Generate the package and driver files:
     tex pageslts.dtx
d) Install the file `pageslts.sty' in your TDS tree:
     cp pageslts.sty TDS:tex/latex/pageslts/
   Replace `TDS:' by the prefix of your TDS tree
   (texmf directory).
e) Create the documentation, if necessary, e.g.
     pdflatex pageslts.dtx
     makeindex -s gind.ist pageslts.idx
     pdflatex pageslts.dtx
     makeindex -s gind.ist pageslts.idx
     pdflatex pageslts.dtx
f) Update the databases, if necessary, e.g. for teTeX:
     mktexlsr .../texmf
g) Create the pageslts-example.pdf, if necessary, e.g.
     pdflatex pageslts-example.tex
     pdflatex pageslts-example.tex
     pdflatex pageslts-example.tex
h) Copy the documentation files to
   "TDS:doc/latex/pageslts/":
   README, pageslts.pdf, pageslts-example.tex,
   pageslts-example.pdf.


4 ADDITIONAL PACKAGES
=====================

The pageslts.sty for LaTeX2e (i. e. all documents using the
pageslts package) requires:
- TeXFormat LaTeX2e, 2015/01/01
- package atveryend, 2011/06/30, v1.8, https://www.ctan.org/pkg/atveryend
- package everyshi, 2001/05/15, v3.00, https://www.ctan.org/pkg/everyshi
- package kvoptions, 2011/06/30, v3.11, https://www.ctan.org/pkg/kvoptions
- package letltxmacro, 2010/09/02, v1.4, https://www.ctan.org/pkg/letltxmacro
- package ltxcmds, 2011/11/09, v1.22, https://www.ctan.org/pkg/ltxcmds
- package rerunfilecheck, 2011/04/15, v1.7, https://www.ctan.org/pkg/rerunfilecheck
- package undolabl, 2015/03/29, v1.0l, https://www.ctan.org/pkg/undolabl

The pageslts-example.tex requires the same files as all
documents using the pageslts package, and additionally:
- class article, 2014/09/29, v1.4h, from classes.dtx: https://www.ctan.org/pkg/classes
- package alphalph, 2011/05/13, v2.4, https://www.ctan.org/pkg/alphalph
- package lipsum, 2014/07/27, v1.3, https://www.ctan.org/pkg/lipsum
- package showkeys, 2014/10/28, v3.17, https://www.ctan.org/pkg/showkeys
- package hyperref, 2012/11/06, v6.83m, https://www.ctan.org/pkg/hyperref
- package pageslts, 2015/12/21, v1.2f, https://www.ctan.org/pkg/pageslts
    (Well, it is the example file for this package, and
     because you are reading the README for the pageslts
     package, it can be assumed that you already have some
     version of it - is it the current one?)
which again load other packages
(see the result of the \listfiles command in the log-file
 of the example).
Also the pageslts.dtx loads other packages 
(for unpacking and constructing the documentation), 
see "7.1 Downloads" in the manual
http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/pageslts/pageslts.pdf


5 PACKAGE COMPATIBILITY
=======================

* endfloat package:
  pageslts is not compatible with very old versions of
  endfloat(2.0 and older).
  Just get the recent version of the endfloat package from
  https://www.ctan.org/pkg/endfloat

* lastpage package:
  \usepackage[pagecontinue=false]{pageslts}
  can simulate the behaviour of the lastpage package.
  Loading old (!) versions of the lastpage package before
  the pageslts package before the hyperref package results
  in multiply definitions of the LastPage label.

* undolabl package:
  Version >= 1.0h is needed.

* The romanbarpagenumber and pageslts package currently are
  not compatible.

7 BUG REPORTS
==============

A bug report should contain:
* Comprehensive problem description. This includes error or
  warning messages.
* \errorcontextlines=\maxdimen can be added in the
  TeX code to get more information in TeX error messages.
* Minimal test file that shows the problem, but does not
  contain any unnecessary packages and code.
* Used drivers/programs.
* Version information about used packages and programs.
* If you are using LaTeX, then add "\listfiles". Then
  a list of version information is printed at the end
  of the LaTeX run.
* Please no other files than the minimal test file.
  The other files .log, .dvi, .ps, .pdf are seldom
  necessary, so send them only on request.
* Please .zip or .tar.gz your file(s) before sending them!
