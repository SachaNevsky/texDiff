This is a slightly modified version of the namedplus style, which fully conforms
with the Journal of Neuroscience citation style.

version = 1.00 of jneurosci.bst 2004 April 06

The following citation labels are implemented:

\citeauthoryear{author-info}{year}:
  these labels are processed by the following commands: 
\cite{key}: 
  which produces citations with both author and year, enclosed in parens. 
\shortcite{key}: 
  which produces citations with year only, enclosed in parens 
\citeauthor{key}: 
  which produces the author information only 
\citeyear{key}: 
  which produces the year information only 
\citetext{key}: 
  which produces Author (Year) 
\citenoparens{key}: 
  which produces Author, Year 
 
The output looks like that:
\cite{key}:
  (Strettoi and Masland, 1996; Kolb, 1997; Masland, 2001) and (Fisher et al., 1975)
\citetext{key}:
  for reviews, see McNaughton (1990); Müller and Kaupp (1998); Fain et al. (2001).

The bibliography follows J Neurosci conventions, e.g.:
Koch C (1999) Biophysics of Computation: Information Processing in Single Neurons Oxford University Press.
Enroth-Cugell C, Robson JG (1966) The contrast sensitivity of retinal ganglion cells of the cat. J Physiol 187:517-552.
