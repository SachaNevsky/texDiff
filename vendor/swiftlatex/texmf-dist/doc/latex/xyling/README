This is the file README for xyling.sty.  For full documentation, read
xyli-doc.pdf.

xyling.sty is a set of macros based on xypic.sty, considered to make
it easier to draw the kind of graphical objects that are frequently
used in linguistics, such as, first of all, phrase structure trees,
but also phonological structures. It is highly flexible and can easily
be extended to any kind of schematic object that combines text with
lines, boxes etc.

Requirements: xypic

Licensing of this package is covered by LPPL.
