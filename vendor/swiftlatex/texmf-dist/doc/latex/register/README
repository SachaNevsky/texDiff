REGISTER
Hardware register diagrams with field descriptions.


Description
-----------

This package is designed for typesetting the programmable elements in
digital hardware, i.e., registers.  Such registers typically have many
fields and can be quite wide; they are thus a challenge to typeset in
a consistent manner.  Register is similar in some aspects to the
bytefield and bitpattern packages.  Anyone doing hardware
documentation using LaTeX should examine those packages.

Register requires version 2001/07/25 or newer of the float package.

An example Perl module and script are provided, to convert the
register specifications into structures suitable for, say, a
pre-silicon test environment.


Building package
----------------

tex register.ins       <== Produces register.sty (the package proper)
latex register.dtx     <== Produces register.dvi (the documentation)
latex register.dtx     <== Incorporates list of registers into
                            register.dvi

One can substitute pdflatex in the commands above to produce PDF
directly.

Note that register comes with pre-built documentation.  The
documentation includes some representative examples of package usage.
