# invoice2 – Intelligent invoices with LaTeX3

## What is it?

While there already are several solutions for LaTeX invoices, most are either
sum-it-yourself templates and the [invoice](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/invoice)
package, which appears to be unmaintained and fails to work for my documents,
especially documents using KOMA-Script. Since LaTeX3 offers a comfortable
interface for working with caculations, this package (re-)implements invoice
functionalioty using LaTeX3.

## Obtaining the Source Code
