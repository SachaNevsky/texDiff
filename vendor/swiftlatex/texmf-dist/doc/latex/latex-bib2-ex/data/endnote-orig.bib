   abstract = {Although it has been recognized that echolocating bats may experience jamming from the signals of conspecifics, research on this problem has focused exclusively on time-frequency adjustments in the emitted signals to minimize interference. Here, we report a surprising new strategy used by bats to avoid interference, namely silence. In a quantitative study of flight and vocal behavior of the big brown bat (Eptesicus fuscus), we discovered that the bat spends considerable time in silence when flying with conspecifics. Silent behavior, defined here as at least one bat in a pair ceasing vocalization for more than 0.2 s (200 ms), occurred as much as 76% of the time (mean of 40% across 7 pairs) when their separation was shorter than 1 m, but only 0.08% when a single bat flew alone. Spatial separation, heading direction, and similarity in call design of paired bats were related to the prevalence of this silent behavior. Our data suggest that the bat uses silence as a strategy to avoid interference from sonar vocalizations of its neighbor, while listening to conspecific-generated acoustic signals to guide orientation. Based on previous neurophysiological studies of the bat's auditory midbrain, we hypothesize that environmental sounds (including vocalizations produced by other bats) and active echolocation evoke neural activity in different populations of neurons. Our findings offer compelling evidence that the echolocating bat switches between active and passive sensing to cope with a complex acoustic environment, and these results hold broad implications for research on navigation and communication throughout the animal kingdom.},

   abstract = {Roost use by bats is likely affected by their water balance and thermoregulatory abilities. To test this hypothesis, we explored the relationship between 4 traits of different species of bats (body size, general food habits, taxonomic group, and thermoregulatory pattern) and microclimates at roosts (temperature and humidity). We recorded roost variables and presence of bats in 18 caves from 5 contrasting biomes in central Mexico. There was little evidence of microclimatic specificity among the 23 species studied, but maternity colonies used warmer roosts and hibernating bats used cooler roosts. Heterothermic species (Vespertilionidae) used colder caves with the widest temperature range (1.6-29.8degreesC), whereas homeothermic species (Emballonuridae, Mormoopidae, Phyllostomidae, and Natalidae) occupied warmer roosts (14.5-37.5degreesC). Within these caves, precise (narrow body temperature range) homeotherms occupied slightly cooler roosts than more labile homeotherms. Body size alone was not associated with cave use patterns. However, when homeotherms and heterotherms were examined separately, body size and temperature were negatively correlated. The smallest homeothermic insectivorous species (<10 g) consistently occupied roosts with temperatures >20degreesC (more often >25degreesC), whereas only the largest homeothermic insectivores were found as low as 16degreesC. Frugivorous, nectarivorous, and sanguivorous bats were found in a wide range of temperatures (14.5-37degreesC), but often at <20degreesC. Humidity in roosts was highly variable for most species and we did not detect any trend regarding this factor. Our data suggest that the thermoregulatory ability resulting from the complex interaction of body size, type of food, and taxonomic affiliation constrains species with respect to types of roosts that they can successfully exploit. Our results support the hypothesis that temperature is the most important physical factor influencing roost selection in bats.},

Here we show that rooks, a member of the corvid family that do not appear to use tools in the wild are capable of insightful problem solving related to sophisticated tool use, including spontaneously modifying and using a variety of tools, shaping hooks out of wire, and using a series of tools in a sequence to gain a reward. It is remarkable that a species that does not use tools in the wild appears to possess an understanding of tools rivaling habitual tool users such as New Caledonian crows and chimpanzees. Our findings suggest that the ability to represent tools may be a domain-general cognitive capacity rather than an adaptive specialization and questions the relationship between physical intelligence and wild tool use.},

   abstract = {Bats use echolocation to exploit a variety of habitats and food types. Much research has documented how frequency-time features of echolocation calls are adapted to acoustic constraints imposed by habitat and prey but emitted sound intensities have received little attention. Bats from the family of Phyllostomidae have been categorised as low intensity ( whispering) gleaners, assumed to emit echolocation calls with low source levels ( approximately 70dBSPL measured 10cm from the bat's mouth). We used a multi-microphone array to determine intensities emitted from two phyllostomid bats from Panama with entirely different foraging strategies. Macrophyllum macrophyllum hunts insects on the wing and gaffs them with its tail membrane and feet from or above water surfaces whereas Artibeus jamaicensis picks fruit from vegetation with its mouth. Recordings were made from bats foraging on the wing in a flight room. Both species emitted surprisingly intense signals with maximum source levels of 105dBSPLr.m.s. for M. macrophyllum and 110dBSPLr.m.s. for A. jamaicensis, hence much louder than a 'whisper'. M. macrophyllum was consistently loud ( mean source level 101dBSPL) whereas A. jamaicensis showed a much more variable output, including many faint calls and a mean source level of 96dBSPL. Our results support increasing evidence that echolocating bats in general are much louder than previously thought. We discuss the importance of loud calls and large output flexibility for both species in an ecological context.},

The prey capture performance of the bat dropped significantly in the tragus-deflection condition, compared with baseline, control, and recovery conditions. Target localization error occurred in the tragus-deflected bat, and mainly in elevation. The deflection of the tragus did not abolish the prey capture ability of the bat, which suggests that other cues are available used for prey localization. Adaptive vocal and motor behaviors were also investigated in this study. The bat did not show significant changes in vocal behaviors but modified its flight trajectories in response to the tragus manipulation. The tragus-deflected bat tended to attack the prey item from above and had lower tangential velocity and larger bearing from the side, compared with baseline and recovery conditions. These findings highlight the contribution of the tragus to vertical sound localization in the free-flying big brown bat and demonstrate flight adaptations the bat makes to compensate altered acoustic cues.},

   abstract = {As humans, our thoughts are not "stuck in time." Indeed, it is our ability to mentally dissociate ourselves from the present that allows us to recall the past and plan for our future (mental time travel). We can also reason about what others might be thinking (mental attribution) and thus dissociate ourselves from other selves. Many psychologists have argued that these two forms of mental projection into other times and other minds are unique to humans and that the six-layered prefrontal cortex is the necessary platform for such intelligence. Recent studies challenge these assumptions, however, and some of the most convincing evidence comes not from our closest relatives, the great apes, but from a surprisingly smart, large-brained bird, the western scrub-jay. Like many other members of the crow family (corvids), these birds hide food for the future and go to great lengths to prevent other birds from stealing their caches. In terms of recalling the past, these birds form complex, highly flexible and integrated memories of the "what, where and when" of specific past caching episodes. They also recall whether another individual was present at the time of caching, and if so, which bird was watching when, and take protective action accordingly, suggesting that they may also be aware of others' knowledge states. This behaviour is only seen in experienced jays that have been thieves themselves in the past, however. Nave birds that had no thieving experience do not do so, a result that raises the intriguing possibility that experienced jays are able to simulate another bird's viewpoint. Finally, recent work demonstrates that the jays also make provision for a future need and will cache more food in places in which they will not be given breakfast the following morning than in places where they will receive breakfast the next morning, even though there is plenty of food available to them to consume at the time of making their caching decisions. We shall argue that, taken together, these results suggest that these birds do possess some knowledge of both other minds and other times, and since birds do not have a six-layered cortical arrangement, these results also challenge the assumption that the mammalian brain is the essential platform for the evolution of these cognitive processes.},

   abstract = {Comparative psychologists interested in the evolution of intelligence have focused their attention on social primates, whereas birds tend to be used as models of associative learning. However, corvids and parrots, which have forebrains relatively the same size as apes, live in complex social groups and have a long developmental period before becoming independent, have demonstrated ape-like intelligence. Although, ornithologists have documented thousands of hours observing birds in their natural habitat, they have focused their attention on avian behaviour and ecology, rather than intelligence. This review discusses recent studies of avian cognition contrasting two different approaches; the anthropocentric approach and the adaptive specialization approach. It is argued that the most productive method is to combine the two approaches. This is discussed with respects to recent investigations of two supposedly unique aspects of human cognition; episodic memory and theory of mind. In reviewing the evidence for avian intelligence, corvids and parrots appear to be cognitively superior to other birds and in many cases even apes. This suggests that complex cognition has evolved in species with very different brains through a process of convergent evolution rather than shared ancestry, although the notion that birds and mammals may share common neural connectivity patterns is discussed.},

Although this apparent lack of understanding might be interpreted as a reflection of a general failure of animals to appreciate 'folk physics', recent studies suggest that some non-tool using species perform rather well on such laboratory tasks. In some animals, tool use and manufacture may also engage aspects of planning, but some non-tool using species have also been shown to demonstrate prospective cognition. Consequently, we argue that habitual tool use is not a clear predictor of physical intelligence, for either instrumental tool tasks or tests of planning.},

   abstract = {The 'social intelligence hypothesis' was originally conceived to explain how primates may have evolved their superior intellect and large brains when compared with other animals. Although some birds such as corvids may be intellectually comparable to apes, the same relationship between sociality and brain size seen in primates has not been found for birds, possibly suggesting a role for other non-social factors. But bird sociality is different from primate sociality. Most monkeys and apes form stable groups, whereas most birds are monogamous, and only form large flocks outside of the breeding season. Some birds form lifelong pair bonds and these species tend to have the largest brains relative to body size. Some of these species are known for their intellectual abilities (e.g. corvids and parrots), while others are not (e.g. geese and albatrosses). Although socio-ecological factors may explain some of the differences in brain size and intelligence between corvids/parrots and geese/albatrosses, we predict that the type and quality of the bonded relationship is also critical. Indeed, we present empirical evidence that rook and jackdaw partnerships resemble primate and dolphin alliances. Although social interactions within a pair may seem simple on the surface, we argue that cognition may play an important role in the maintenance of long-term relationships, something we name as 'relationship intelligence'.},

   abstract = {Reconciliation, a post-conflict affiliative interaction between former opponents, is an important mechanism for reducing the costs of aggressive conflict in primates and some other mammals as it may repair the opponents' relationship and reduce post-conflict distress. Opponents who share a valuable relationship are expected to be more likely to reconcile as for such partners the benefits of relationship repair should outweigh the risk of renewed aggression. In birds, however, post-conflict behavior has thus far been marked by an apparent absence of reconciliation, suggested to result either from differing avian and mammalian strategies or because birds may not share valuable relationships with partners with whom they engage in aggressive conflict. Here, we demonstrate the occurrence of reconciliation in a group of captive subadult ravens (Corvus corax) and show that it is more likely to occur after conflicts between partners who share a valuable relationship. Furthermore, former opponents were less likely to engage in renewed aggression following reconciliation, suggesting that reconciliation repairs damage caused to their relationship by the preceding conflict. Our findings suggest not only that primate-like valuable relationships exist outside the pair bond in birds, but that such partners may employ the same mechanisms in birds as in primates to ensure that the benefits afforded by their relationships are maintained even when conflicts of interest escalate into aggression. These results provide further support for a convergent evolution of social strategies in avian and mammalian species.},

Some of these features were investigated with a series of tasks designed to assess human infant development. The tasks were presented to young parakeets to assess their means-end problem solving abilities. Examples of these early skills are: attaining and playing with objects, retrieving rewards through use of a stick or rake, or by pulling in rewards on supports or on the ends of strings. Twelve such tasks were presented to 11 young yellow-crowned parakeets (Cyano-ramphus auriceps) to investigate their natural abilities; there was no attempt to train them to do those tasks that they did not spontaneously perform. Six of the birds were parent-raised and five were hand-raised. The birds completed 9 of the 12 tasks, demonstrating all the Piagetian sensorimotor circular reactions, but they failed to hand-watch ("claw-watch"), to stack objects, or to fill a container. Their ordinality on the tasks differed from that of human infants in that locomotion to obtain objects occurred earlier in the avian sequence of development and the mid-level tasks were performed by the two groups of avian subjects in a mixed order perhaps indicating that these abilities may not emerge in any particular order for these birds as they supposedly do for human infants. The hand-raised group needed fewer sessions to complete these means-end tasks.},

   abstract = {Evidence of metamemory, the ability to monitor one's own memory, has been obtained in some primates, but it appears to be weaker in other species. In this study, we examined whether crows flexibly modulate their behavior by monitoring the strength of memory trace in a delayed matching-to-sample task using two paradigms. First, crows performing a memory test were given an escape option to decline taking the test (prospective metamemory). Second, crows were given the escape option as a "not confident" report after completing the test (retrospective metamemory). Accurate memory performance yielded a reward with a higher probability, whereas inaccurate memory performance resulted in no such recompense. The escape option yielded a reward with a lower probability. In the prospective metamemory test, crows escaped the memory test more frequently with longer delay intervals than they did with shorter delay intervals but no more frequently in the sample-omission than the sample-present trials, indicating that the crows decided to take the test or decline it by using the delay interval as a cue. In contrast, in the retrospective metamemory test, the crows escaped the memory test more frequently when their memory-test response was incorrect than correct and more frequently in the sample-omission than the sample-present trials, indicating that the crows recognized confidence regarding their choice in the memory test and utilized the escape option to maximize reward probability. Although these results suggest that crows retrospectively monitor the strength of memory trace, their prospective metamemory ability has not yet been confirmed in the present paradigm.},

   abstract = {The superior olivary complex (SOC) is a mammalian auditory brainstem structure that contains several nuclei. Some of them are part of the ascending system projecting to higher auditory centers, others belong to the descending system projecting to the cochlear nuclei or the cochlea itself. The main nuclei of the ascending system, the lateral and medial superior olive (LSO, MSO), as well as the lateral and medial nuclei of the trapezoid body (LNTB, MNTB), have been traditionally associated with sound localization. Here we review the results of recent studies on the main SOC nuclei in echolocating bats. These studies suggest that some SOC structures and functions are highly conserved across mammals (e.g., the LSO, which is associated with interaural intensity difference processing), while others are phylogenetically highly variable in both form and function (e.g., the MSO, traditionally associated with interaural time difference processing). For the MSO, these variations indicate that we should broaden our view regarding what functions the MSO might participate in, since its function in echolocation seems to lie in the context of pattern recognition rather than sound localization. Furthermore, across bat species, variations in the form and physiology of the MSO can be linked to specific behavioral adaptations associated with different echolocation strategies. Finally, the comparative approach, including auditory specialists such as bats, helps us to reach a more comprehensive view of the functional anatomy of auditory structures that are still poorly understood, like the nucleus of the central acoustic tract (NCAT).},

   abstract = {Like dolphins, bats are known to possess highly developed SONAR systems in air. Echolocating bats can be divided into two groups: the CF-FM and FM bats depending on frequency structure of their pulses. In this study, we used one of Japanese FM bat species, Pipistrellus abramus. The echolocation behavior was examined for two different flight tasks: (a) field recording while capturing insects in the open area, and (b) recording for a landing approach to a target wall in the laboratory. We acoustically compared these two echolocations by the bats while approaching a target. In the field and laboratory, repetition rates of pulse emission in the search phase were constant at approximately 10 pulses/s. When approach phase was started, the bats increased the repetition rate of the pulse emission to 140-190 pulses/s. We found that the pulse duration was dynamically decreased from 10 to 0.5 ins during prey capturing in the field, whereas it ranged from 0.5 to 3-4 ms in the laboratory. A CF-like portion (a narrow slope portion at the end of pulse) was observed to follow the initial FM sweep beyond approximately 2 in of the target distance in the laboratory. Interestingly, the CF-like portion was found to be extended by the bats in the field and such long pulse duration was never seen in the laboratory. This suggests that FM bats use not only broadband signals, but also narrowband signals for echolocation in the far target range as CF-FM bat species. Biosonar animals might have been supposed to adapt their echolocation to underlying physical law in nature or their environment through their evolutionary history. These comparative studies between the field and laboratory recordings are expected to help our understanding of bat's biosonar system, and various echolocation strategies employed by the bats will contribute to develop artificial SONAR system or new echo-sensing devices in the future.},

   abstract = {New Caledonian (NC) crows, Corvus moneduloides, have impressive tool-manufacturing and tool-using skills in the wild, and captive birds have displayed exceptional cognitive abilities in experimental situations. However, their social system is largely unknown. In this study we investigated whether the social structure of NC crows might have had a role in the development of their cognitive skills. We observed crows in their natural habitat on the island of Mare, New Caledonia, and estimated their social network size based on tolerance to family and nonfamily crows at feeding tables. Our findings suggest that NC crows are not a highly social corvid species. Their core unit was the immediate family consisting of a pair and juveniles from up to two consecutive breeding years. Pairs stayed together year round, and were closely accompanied by juveniles during their first year of life. Parents were highly tolerant of juveniles and sometimes continued to feed them well into their second year. NC crows predominantly shared feeding tables with immediate family. Of the nonfamily crows tolerated, juveniles were overrepresented. The main mechanism for any social transmission of foraging skills is likely to be vertical (from parents to offspring), with only limited opportunity for horizontal transmission. The social organization we found on Mare is consistent with the idea that NC crows' multiple pandanus tool designs on mainland Grande Terre are an example of cumulative technological evolution.

   abstract = {Comparative and experimental approaches to cognition in different animal taxa suggest some degree of convergent evolution. Similar cognitive trends associated with similar lifestyles (sociality, generalism, new habitats) are seen in taxa that are phylogenetically distant and possess remarkably different brains. Many cognitive measures show positive intercorrelations at the inter-individual and inter-taxon level, suggesting some degree of general intelligence. Ecological principles like the unpredictability of resources in space and time may drive different types of cognition (e. g., social and non-social) in the same direction. Taxa that rank high on comparative counts of cognition in the field are usually the ones that succeed well in experimental tests, with the exception of avian imitation. From apes to birds, fish and beetles, a few common principles appear to have influenced the evolution of brains and cognition in widely divergent taxa. Copyright (c) 2008 S. Karger AG, Basel},

   abstract = {During the past 24 years, I have used a modeling technique (M/R procedure) to train Grey parrots to use an allospecific code (English speech) referentially; I then use the code to test their cognitive abilities. The oldest bird, Alex, labels more than 50 different objects, 7 colors, 5 shapes, quantities to 6, 3 categories (color, shape, material) and uses 'no', 'come here', wanna go X' and 'want Y' (X and Y are appropriate location or item labels). He combines labels to identify, request, comment upon or refuse more than 100 items and to alter his environment. He processes queries to judge category, relative size, quantity, presence or absence of similarity/difference in attributes, and show label comprehension. He semantically separates labeling from requesting. He thus exhibits capacities once presumed limited to humans or nonhuman primates. Studies on this and other Greys show that parrots given training that lacks some aspect of input present in M/R protocols (reference, functionality, social interaction) fail to acquire referential English speech. Examining how input affects the extent to which parrots acquire an allospecific code may elucidate mechanisms of other forms of exceptional learning: learning unlikely in the normal course of development but that can occur under certain conditions.

Some of these systems allow remote interactions between owners and their pets and others might be adapted for animal-animal interactions.

Examples include the concepts of same/different, colour, size and shape. The parrot Alex can also recognize and distinguish numbers up to six, and spontaneously demonstrated his ability to grasp the concept of "none".

   abstract = {The study of animal behavior, and particularly avian behavior, has advanced significantly in the past 50 years. In the early 1960s, both ethologists and psychologists were likely to see birds as simple automatons, incapable of complex cognitive processing. Indeed, the term "avian cognition" was considered an oxymoron. Avian social interaction was also seen as based on rigid, if sometimes complicated, patterns. The possible effect of social interaction on cognition, or vice versa, was therefore something almost never discussed. Two paradigm shifts - one concerning animal cognition and one concerning social interaction - began to change perceptions in, respectively, the early 1970s and 1980s, but only more recently have researchers actively investigated how these two areas intersect in the study of avian behavior. The fruits of such intersection can be seen in the various papers for this special issue. I provide some brief background material before addressing the striking findings of current projects. In some cases, researchers have adapted early classic methods and in other cases have devised new paradigms, but in all instances have demonstrated avian capacities that were once thought to be the exclusive domain of humans or at least nonhuman primates.},

   abstract = {One of the main characteristics of human societies is the extensive degree of cooperation among individuals. Cooperation is an elaborate phenomenon, also found in non-human primates during laboratory studies and field observations of animal hunting behaviour, among other things. Some authors suggest that the pressures assumed to have favoured the emergence of social intelligence in primates are similar to those that may have permitted the emergence of complex cognitive abilities in some bird species such as corvids and psittacids. In the wild, parrots show cooperative behaviours such as bi-parental care and mobbing. In this study, we tested cooperative problem solving in African grey parrots (Psittacus erithacus). Our birds were tested using several experimental setups to explore the different levels of behavioural organisation between participants, differing in temporal and spatial complexity. In our experiments, African grey parrots were able to act simultaneously but mostly failed during the delay task, maybe because of a lack of inhibitory motor response. Confronted with the possibility to adapt their behaviour to the presence or absence of a partner, they showed that they were able to coordinate their actions. They also collaborated, acting complementarily in order to solve tasks, but they were not able to place themselves in the partner's role.},

   abstract = {Recent studies on the food-caching behavior of corvids have revealed complex physical and social skills, yet little is known about the ontogeny of food caching in relation to the development of cognitive capacities. Piagetian object permanence is the understanding that objects continue to exist even when they are no longer visible. Here, the authors focus on Piagetian Stages 3 and 4, because they are hallmarks in the cognitive development of both young children and animals. Our aim is to determine in a food-caching corvid, the Western scrub-jay, whether (1) Piagetian Stage 4 competence and tentative caching (i.e., hiding an item invisibly and retrieving it without delay), emerge concomitantly or consecutively; (2) whether experiencing the reappearance of hidden objects enhances the timing of the appearance of object permanence; and (3) discuss how the development of object permanence is related to behavioral development and sensorimotor intelligence. Our findings suggest that object permanence Stage 4 emerges before tentative caching, and independent of environmental influences, but that once the birds have developed simple object-permanence, then social learning might advance the interval after which tentative caching commences.},

   abstract = {Our ability to make logical inferences is considered as one of the cornerstones of human intelligence, fuelling investigations of reasoning abilities in non-human animals. Yet, the evidence to date is equivocal, with apes as the prime candidates to possess these skills. For instance, in a two-choice task, apes can identify the location of hidden food if it is indicated by a rattling noise caused by the shaking of a baited container. More importantly, they also use the absence of noise during the shaking of the empty container to infer that this container is not baited. However, since the inaugural report of apes solving this task, to the best of our knowledge, no comparable evidence could be found in any other tested species such as monkeys and dogs. Here, we report the first successful and instantaneous solution of the shaking task through logical inference by a non-ape species, the African grey parrot. Surprisingly, the performance of the birds was sensitive to the shaking movement: they were successful with containers shaken horizontally, but not with vertical shaking resembling parrot head-bobbing. Thus, grey parrots seem to possess ape-like cross-modal reasoning skills, but their reliance on these abilities is influenced by low-level interferences.},

   abstract = {This paper addresses the question of how the brain of an animal achieves cognitive integration-that is to say how it manages to bring its fullest resources to bear on an ongoing situation. To fully exploit its cognitive resources, whether inherited or acquired through experience, it must be possible for unanticipated coalitions of brain processes to form. This facilitates the novel recombination of the elements of an existing behavioural repertoire, and thereby enables innovation. But in a system comprising massively many anatomically distributed assemblies of neurons, it is far from clear how such open-ended coalition formation is possible. The present paper draws on contemporary findings in brain connectivity and neurodynamics, as well as the literature of artificial intelligence, to outline a possible answer in terms of the brain's most richly connected and topologically central structures, its so-called connective core.},

The central question in the study of insightful behaviour in any species is whether it is the product of a distinctive cognitive process, insight. Although some claims for insight in animals confuse it with other problem-solving processes, contemporary research on string pulling and other physical problems, primarily with birds, has uncovered new examples of insightful behaviour and shed light on the role of experience in producing it. New research suggests insightful behaviour can be captured in common laboratory tasks while brain activity is monitored, opening the way to better integration of research on animals with the cognitive neuroscience of human insight.},

The earliest bats are recorded from the Early Eocene of North America, Europe, North Africa and Australia where they seem to appear suddenly and simultaneously. Until now, the oldest record in Asia was from the Middle Eocene. In this paper, we report the discovery of the oldest bat fauna of Asia dating from the Early Eocene of the Cambay Formation at Vastan Lignite Mine in Western India. The fossil taxa are described on the basis of well-preserved fragments of dentaries and lower teeth. The fauna is highly diversified and is represented by seven species belonging to seven genera and at least four families. Two genera and five species are new. Three species exhibit very primitive dental characters, whereas four others indicate more advanced states. Unexpectedly, this fauna presents strong affinities with the European faunas from the French Paris Basin and the German Messel locality. This could result from the limited fossil record of bats in Asia, but could also suggest new palaeobiogeographic scenarios involving the relative position of India during the Early Eocene.},

   abstract = {The ability to make inferences about hidden causal mechanisms underpins scientific and religious thought. It also facilitates the understanding of social interactions and the production of sophisticated tool-using behaviors. However, although animals can reason about the outcomes of accidental interventions, only humans have been shown to make inferences about hidden causal mechanisms. Here, we show that tool-making New Caledonian crows react differently to an observable event when it is caused by a hidden causal agent. Eight crows watched two series of events in which a stick moved. In the first set of events, the crows observed a human enter a hide, a stick move, and the human then leave the hide. In the second, the stick moved without a human entering or exiting the hide. The crows inspected the hide and abandoned probing with a tool for food more often after the second, unexplained series of events. This difference shows that the crows can reason about a hidden causal agent. Comparative studies with the methodology outlined here could aid in elucidating the selective pressures that led to the evolution of this cognitive ability.},

Here, we present a highly resolved molecular phylogeny for all extant bat families. Our results support the hypothesis that megabats are nested among four major microbat lineages, which originated in the early Eocene [52 to 50 million years ago (Mya)], coincident with a significant global rise in temperature, increase in plant diversity and abundance, and the zenith of Tertiary insect diversity. Our data suggest that bats originated in Laurasia, possibly in North America, and that three of the major microbat lineages are Laurasian in origin, whereas the fourth is Gondwanan. Combining principles of ghost lineage analysis with molecular divergence dates, we estimate that the bat fossil record underestimates (unrepresented basal branch length, UBBL) first occurrences by, on average, 73% and that the sum of missing fossil history is 61%.},

   abstract = {Humans and other animals often find it difficult to choose a delayed reward over an immediate one, even when the delay leads to increased pay-offs. Using a visible incremental reward procedure, we tested the ability of three grey parrots to maintain delay of gratification for an increasingly valuable food pay-off. Up to five sunflower seeds were placed within the parrot's reach, one at a time, at a rate of one seed per second. When the parrot took a seed the trial was ended and the birds consumed the accumulated seeds. Parrots were first tested in daily sessions of ten trials and then with single daily trials. For multiple trial sessions, all three parrots showed some limited improvement across 30 sessions. For single trial sessions, only one parrot showed any increase in seed acquisition across trials. This parrot was also able to consistently obtain two or more seeds per trial (across both multiple and single trial conditions) but was unable to able to wait 5 s to obtain the maximum number of seeds. This parrot was also tested on a slower rate of seed presentation, and this significantly reduced her mean seed acquisition in both multiple and single trial conditions, suggesting that both value of reward available and delay duration impact upon self-control. Further manipulation of both the visibility and proximity of seeds during delay maintenance had little impact upon tolerance of delays for both parrots tested in this condition. This task demanded not just a choice of delayed reward but the maintenance of delayed gratification and was clearly difficult for the parrots to learn; additional training or alternative paradigms are required to better understand the capacity for self-control in this and other species.},

   abstract = {Creative problem solving and innovative tool use in animals are often seen as indicators of advanced intelligence because they seem to imply causal reasoning abilities [1]. However, complex behavior can also arise from relatively simple mechanisms [2, 3], and the cognitive operations underlying seemingly "insightful" behavior are rarely examined [4]. By controlling and varying prior experience, it is possible to determine the minimum information animals require to solve a given problem [5]. We investigated how pretesting experience affects the performance of New Caledonian crows (Corvus moneduloides) when facing a novel problem. The task (developed by Bird and Emery [6]) required dropping stones into a vertical tube to collapse an out-of-reach platform in a transparent box and release a food reward. After establishing that the birds had no preexisting tendency to drop stones into holes, subjects were assigned to two experimental groups that were given different kinds of experience with the affordances of the apparatus. Crows that had learned about the mechanism (collapsibility) of the platform without the use of stones passed the task, just like the subjects that had previously been trained to drop stones. This demonstrates that successful innovation was also possible after acquaintance with just the functional properties of the task.},

   abstract = {Their sonar system allows echolocating bats to navigate with high skill through a complex, three- dimensional environment at high speed and low light. The auditory analysis of the echoes of their ultrasonic sounds requires a detailed comparison of the emission and echoes. Here an auditory model of bat sonar is introduced and evaluated against a set of psychophysical phantom-target, echo-acoustic experiments. The model consists of a relatively detailed simulation of auditory peripheral processing in the bat, Phyllostomus discolor, followed by a functional module consisting of a strobed, normalised, autocorrelation in each frequency channel. The model output is accumulated in a sonar image buffer. The model evaluation is based on the comparison of the image-buffer contents generated in individually simulated psychophysical trials. The model provides reasonably good predictions for both temporal and spectral behavioural sonar processing in terms of sonar delay-, roughness, and phase sensitivity and in terms of sensitivity to the temporal separations in two-front targets and the classification of spectrally divergent phantom targets.},

   abstract = {Classification of plants according to their echoes is an elementary component of bat behavior that plays an important role in spatial orientation and food acquisition. Vegetation echoes are, however, highly complex stochastic signals: from an acoustical point of view, a plant can be thought of as a three-dimensional array of leaves reflecting the emitted bat call. The received echo is therefore a superposition of many reflections. In this work we suggest that the classification of these echoes might not be such a troublesome routine for bats as formerly thought. We present a rather simple approach to classifying signals from a large database of plant echoes that were created by ensonifying plants with a frequency-modulated bat-like ultrasonic pulse. Our algorithm uses the spectrogram of a single echo from which it only uses features that are undoubtedly accessible to bats. We used a standard machine learning algorithm ( SVM) to automatically extract suitable linear combinations of time and frequency cues from the spectrograms such that classification with high accuracy is enabled. This demonstrates that ultrasonic echoes are highly informative about the species membership of an ensonified plant, and that this information can be extracted with rather simple, biologically plausible analysis. Thus, our findings provide a new explanatory basis for the poorly understood observed abilities of bats in classifying vegetation and other complex objects.},

   abstract = {Modem concepts of thinking (reasoning) in vertebrate animals as an evolutionary prerequisite of human intelligence are considered. A brief history of the problem, definitions, classification, and the main trends of studies are given. The simplest forms of animal thinking (extrapolation and categorization abilities) are shown to manifest themselves in many species of vertebrates, beginning from reptiles. This fact attest that reasoning prerequisites emerged at the early phylogenetic stages. Similar gradations of reasoning complexity were characteristic of birds and mammals, and they are shown to correlate with the brain structural and functional complexity. The higher the phylogenetic developmental level in species and the more complex the structure and function of their brain, the wider the range of reasoning abilities in these species. Highly developed mammals are not only capable of complex concept formation but of symbolization as well. Large apes appear to be capable to acquire simple forms of human language (ameslan, yerkish) and to use them for communication in a symbolic manner being compared with that in three-year-old children. The data obtained in experiments of physiologists and psychologists were verified using natural observations. These combined results promoted the development of new concepts, which connect the reasoning ability and behavioral adaptability. The behavioral pattern of animals in captivity was shown to correspond to that in nature. Classic ethology concepts, the problem of animal thinking, the significance of current ethological studies of vertebrates are discussed. Long-term and regular observations in nature have revealed a number of forms of animal reasoning, which were not described in the laboratory. The complete knowledge of the species-specific behavioral repertoire helps to exclude from a reasoning list those behavioral phenomena, which were falsely attributed earlier to categories of reasoning.},

   abstract = {New evidence of functional analogies and homologies of bird and mammal brain is given; some nomenclature revision of the most important brain structures is performed. Comparative characteristics of the bird brain and criteria of its progressive development in phylogeny are considered. The possibility to use the Portman's index as an indicator of brain complexity in different species is analyzed. The necessity to study new model bird species with the "medium" (Parus caeruleus and Loxia curvirostra) and "lowest" (Larus glaucescens) levels of brain complexity is substantiated to maintain a fully-based ground for comparing the cognitive abilities of birds. A review of the experimentally supported proofs suggesting the existence of elementary thinking and some other cognitive functions among higher birds is presented. The high levels of cognitive processes that underlie the tool-using of birds, as well as their similarity in anthropoids are shown based on the results obtained in the 2000s. The comparative studies with battery of string-pulling tests confirm the ability of hooded crows and ravens to solve the tool-use tasks immediately, while birds with a "medium" level of brain complexity appear to resort to a simpler mechanism to make success. In the birds of different orders with the "highest" brain complexity (for instance, corvids and parrots), the dynamics of abstract concept-formation are similar. The "medium-level" crossbills, although they can also form the same concepts, perform this process worse than corvids do, whereas the "lowest-level" seagulls and pigeons are not able to operate any abstractions or capable of solving other cognitive tests. The fact that corvids and parrots and anthropoids have similar abilities to successfully solve numerous cognitive tasks supports the hypothesis of the convergent evolution of brain and cognition in birds and primates.},
