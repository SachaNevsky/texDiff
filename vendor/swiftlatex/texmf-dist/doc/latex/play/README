This is the README file for the play package.
You should download the play.dtx and play.ins files.
To extract the package run LaTeX on the file play.ins.  This will
generate two files: play.sty and play.cls.  These files should be
placed somewhere where TeX can find them.
For documentation you should run LaTeX on the file play.dtx.
I hope you find these macros useful.
