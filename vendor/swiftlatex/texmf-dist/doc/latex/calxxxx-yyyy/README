1 INTRODUCTION
==============

To print a calendar for some given years, use the \textsf{calxxxx-yyyy.tex}
file. LaTeXe it, type in the year to start with (for example 2020), the
year to end with (for example 2037), and the calendars for those years are
produced.

It is possible to print the calendars in different languages.
Currently English (with week running from Sunday to Saturday),
and Danish and German (with week running from Monday to Sunday) are supported,
but other languages can be added. (When you did a translation, please send
an e-mail with it to Martin DOT Muench AT Uni-Bonn DOT de,
so that it might be included in calxxxx-yyyy.tex, thanks!)

Note: The code of this "package" is based on calxxxx.tex,
which is © 1999 Slobodan Jankovi\'{c} (Thanks!).

6 BUG REPORTS
==============

A bug report should contain:
* Comprehensive problem description. This includes error or
  warning messages.
* \errorcontextlines=\maxdimen can be added in the
  TeX code to get more information in TeX error messages.
* Minimal test file that shows the problem, but does not
  contain any unnecessary packages and code.
* Used drivers/programs.
* Version information about used packages and programs.
* If you are using LaTeX, then add "\listfiles". Then
  a list of version information is printed at the end
  of the LaTeX run.
* Please no other files than the minimal test file.
  The other files .log, .dvi, .ps, .pdf are seldom
  necessary, so send them only on request.
* Please .zip or .tar.gz your file(s) before sending them!

7 KNOWN PROBLEMS

* If you request too many years (more than about 141) at once,
  (La)TeX will run out of memory (unless you increase that).
