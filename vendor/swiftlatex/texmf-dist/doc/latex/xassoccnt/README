The package xassoccnt provides a way of associating counters to an 
existing driver counter, such incrementing the driver counter will increase
the associated counters as well. This package can be regarded as a supplement
to the totcount package by Vasileios Koutavas (http://www.ctan.org/pkg/totcount), but
can be used without it too.

As of 2018/12/28 xassoccnt does not supersede the package assoccnt by the same author, however, 
the older package isn't declared obsolete as of 2018/12/28
