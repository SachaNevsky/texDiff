1 INTRODUCTION
==============

This package allows to automatically hyperlink uris of type
arXiv, ASIN, DOI, HDL, NBN, OCLC, OID, PubMed, TINY, TINY with preview,
and WebCite in such a way that they are resolved to an address understood
by browsers and provides commands \citeurl, \mailto, \ukoeln, and \uref.

2 DOWNLOAD
==========

`uri' is available on CTAN:
https://www.ctan.org/pkg/uri

Also a ZIP file is provided that contains the files:
the manual (uri.pdf), the example (uri-example.tex),
the compiled example (uri-example.pdf),
driver (uri.drv), uri.dtx,
installation file (uri.ins), 
the style file (uri.sty),
and this README, already sorted in a TDS tree:
http://mirror.ctan.org/install/macros/latex/contrib/uri.tds.zip


3 INSTALLATION
==============

Installation with ZIP file in TDS format
----------------------------------------
The ZIP file `uri.tds.zip' contains the files
sorted in a TDS tree. Thus you can directly unpack the
ZIP file inside a TDS tree.
See https://www.ctan.org/TDS-guidelines for an explanation
of TDS.
Example:
  cd /...somewhere.../texmf
  unzip /...downloadpath.../uri.tds.zip
Do not forget to refresh the file name database of this
TDS tree.
Example:
  texhash /...somewhere.../texmf

Manual installation
-------------------
a) Download the uri files from CTAN.
   If necessary, unpack them.
b) Generate the package and driver files:
     tex uri.ins
c) Install the file `uri.sty' in your TDS tree:
     cp uri.sty TDS:tex/latex/uri/
   Replace `TDS:' by the prefix of your TDS tree
   (texmf directory).
d) Create the documentation, if necessary, e.g.
     pdflatex uri.dtx
     makeindex -s gind.ist uri.idx
     pdflatex uri.dtx
     makeindex -s gind.ist uri.idx
     pdflatex uri.dtx
e) Update the databases if necessary, e.g. for teTeX:
     mktexlsr .../texmf
f) Create the uri-example.pdf, if necessary, e.g.
     pdflatex uri-example.tex
     pdflatex uri-example.tex
     pdflatex uri-example.tex
g) Copy the documentation files to
   "TDS:doc/latex/uri/":
   README, uri.pdf, uri-example.tex,
   uri-example.pdf.


4 ADDITIONAL PACKAGES
=====================

Depending on the driver and option settings, uri loads
other packages:
* kvoptions.sty:
    https://ctan.org/pkg/kvoptions
* url.sty:
    https://ctan.org/pkg/url
which again load other packages
(see the result of the \listfiles command in the log-file
 of the example).


5 PACKAGE COMPATIBILITY
=======================

uri should be loaded
AFTER  package hyperref, if hyperlinks are wanted, and
BEFORE package hyperref, if hyperlinks are not wanted.

When any of the packages aurl, doi, doipubmed is used,
there might be conflicts or results might depend on order of loading.

7 BUG REPORTS
=============

A bug report should contain:
* Comprehensive problem description. This includes error or
  warning messages.
* \errorcontextlines=\maxdimen can be added in the
  TeX code to get more information in TeX error messages.
* Minimal test file that shows the problem, but does not
  contain any unnecessary packages and code.
* Used drivers/programs.
* Version information about used packages and programs.
* If you are using LaTeX, then add "\listfiles". Then
  a list of version information is printed at the end
  of the LaTeX run.
* Please no other files than the minimal test file.
  The other files .log, .dvi, .ps, .pdf are seldom
  necessary, so send them only on request.
* Please .zip or .tar.gz your file(s) before sending them!
