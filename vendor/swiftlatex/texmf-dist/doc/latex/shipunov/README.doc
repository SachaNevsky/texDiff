1. Description
----------------------

This is the version 1.2 of "shipunov" bundle, collection of LaTeX packages and classes, along with one bibliography style, some independent examples and a set of Perl scripts for converting TeX files. Many of them intend to help field biologists and Russian writers, others have broader application.

Most of packages have example files, with "tex" extension and "-ex" postfix. Some of them are in Russian (codepage Windows-1251 or UTF-8, "-ru" postfix). Documentation files have "-doc" postfix. Besides, some examples did not related with any packages, they just demonstrate how to produce reliable forms for biological (morphometry and floristic/faunistic) fieldwork and also slides and exam sheets for teaching biology.

Any suggestions concerning this package are highly appreciated.

The Russian mini-review can be found in the "review.tex" file, written by Eugene Baldin, with minor corrections of bundle author.

2. Installation
---------------

Extract the zip archive to the $LOCALTEXMF directory of your system. Refresh your filename database. Please see the documentation of your LaTeX distribution for further details.

If someone would like to use this package under MikTex, this is the/a way to install:

a. The "shipunov" directory, with the style files directly under it, should be copied to "[MiKTeX DIR]\tex\latex\" directory.

b. Then in the "Settings" GUI program of MikTex the "Refresh FNDB" button should be pressed (located under the "General" tab of the GUI window).

3. Usage notes
--------------

For Russian examples, LH fonts, "cm-super" and "cyrillic" packages should be installed. Russian hyphenation patterns should be loaded via "babel". For using "rusnat" bibliography style, some preparations are needed in the source bib file (example is in the documentation). To run bibtex on aux-file, I recommend the command like "bibtex8 -B -c cp1251.csf rusnat-ex1-ru.aux". However, there is an evidence that simple "bibtex rusnat-ex1-ru.aux" works as well. Note that "rusnat" bibliography style is now deprecated in favor of "gost" styles.
