Where I work statisticians mostly use SAS and R when doing
calculations or simulations. Thus they need to be able to import
results or source code into their LaTeX projects.

This package is an extension to an earlier (unreleased) package which
only handled SAS. The package simply serve as a sort of front end to
the listings package, creating some new lstlisting like environments
and import macros similar to \lstinputlisting.

All configuration is handled via a hierarchy of listings style.

The is package also capable of overloading the Sweave and SASweave
packages.
