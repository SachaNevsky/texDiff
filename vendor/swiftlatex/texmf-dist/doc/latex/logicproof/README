The `logicproof' package

This package provides environments for creating Fitch-style box proofs for
propositional and predicate logic. In this style, each line of the proof
contains a statement and a justification, and subproofs within the larger
proof are enclosed in a box. For an example of this proof style, see the manual
in logicproof.pdf.
