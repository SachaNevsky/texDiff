This package provides data and commands for including nuclear and atomic mass and energy data in LaTeX documents. It uses the PythonTeX package and requires pythontex.exe to be called with the tex file as the argument.

It reads data from two different csv files: elementlist.csv and massdata.csv which are normally stored in the same folder as the nucleardata.sty file (dist/tex/latex/nucleardata).

The massdata.csv file was created from 2017 ENSDF data files and the file mass16round.txt from ``The Ame2016 atomic mass evaluation '' by W. J. Huang, G.Audi, Meng Wang, F. G. Kondev, S. Naimi, and Xing Xu, _Chinese Physics C_ Vol. 41, No. 3 (2017) 030002 and 030003. Also see https://www-nds.iaea.org/amdc/  Elements 110 through 118 have been updated to the IUPAC approved and proposed names and symbols as of April, 2018.
