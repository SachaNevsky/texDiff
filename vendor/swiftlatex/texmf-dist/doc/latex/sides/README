  WHAT IS SIDES?
  
    sides is a class package for typsetting stage plays in LaTeX2e.
    
    In theater-jargon, ``sides'' are the (imcomplete) copies of the script
    used for auditions and rehearsals.

    This class package was based on the package ``plari'' written by
    Antti-Juhani Kaijanaho in 1998.
    
    
  HOW TO USE SIDES

    Simply start your document off with \documentclass[12pt]{sides}.

    Within the sides class, all text are single spaced and paragraphs
    are not indented. The document is divided into acts and scenes. They each
    have their own counters. Starting a new act starts a new page as well.
    
    The commands are listed below and as comments in the class code.
    
    ``sides-sample.tex'', included with this package, shows example usage
    of every command in sides in a real playwriting context.

    \newact
      creates a new act with heading Act N, N is act number in Roman num
    \newactnamed{actname}
      creates a new act with heading actname, does not increment counter
      this is useful for interludes, prologues, etc.
    \newscene
      creates a new scene with heading Scene M, M is scene number
    \newscenenamed{scname}
      creates a new scene with heading scname, does not increment counter
    \repl{charname} diag
      outputs a line with text diag spoken by charname
    \stagedir{dir}
      outputs italized stage directions dir
    \chara{charname}
      outputs charname in smallcaps, as in repl
    \paren{remark}
      inserts an italized parenthetical remark into the text
    \pause
      an alias for \paren{Pause.}
    \castpage, \castpagelatin
      inserts a cast section, which in reality is just an unnumbered scene
      \castpagelatin outputs ``dramatis personae'' instead of boring English
    \cast{charname}{desc}
      outputs an entry with character charname and description desc
    \notes
      inserts a section for playwright's notes, does not start a new page

    \castpage and \notes are just shorthands, one can always just use
    \newscenenamed{title} to accomplish the same thing.
