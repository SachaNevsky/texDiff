This file describes the LaTeX packages developed and mantained
by F. Bosisio at the "Politecnico di Milano", Italy.
See file "index.html" for a more detailed description of each package.

For information on the whole LaTeX packages visit the CTAN archive
(http://www.ctan.org) or search the CTAN Catalogue online
(http://www.ctan.org/Catalogue).

At now the available packages are:
 * envmath:
   - Extended and more powerful math-environments
   - The new math environments are used to make multi-line formulas and
     systems of equations, both numbered or unnumbered.

 * mathenv:
   - Old name for the "envmath" package
   - Package "mathenv" has been renamed to "envmath", in order to avoid
     conflicts with another package with the same name: if you were using
     the "old" "mathenv" package, you need to change your LaTeX files in
     order to include the new one.

 * mathcmd:
   - Extended math-mode commands
   - New commands include derivatives, vectors operators, arrow-limits,
     integrals and sums.

 * sobolev:
   - Commands to deal with Sobolev and Hilbert spaces
   - The new commands include norm, semi-norm, scalar products, crochet
     symbols, besides the various Sobolev spaces.

 * graphfig:
   - Simple and powerful way of using graphics files inside figures
   - It provides a new "Figure" environment and a "\graphfile" command:
     the combined use of these authomatically produce a correct centering
     of the graph(s) with respect to the page.
     Moreover, subfigures can be handled in the same way and hard-to-discover
     errors (such as a "\label" preceding a "\caption") are eliminated.

 * dblfont:
   - An easy way to define blackboard-bold letters

 * accenti:
   - This package is obsolete and its only aim is to simplify the usage
     of accents in the Italian language.
   - The declaration "\usepackage[latin1]{inputenc}" is a better alternative,
     as it directly allows the use of the accented characters in the document,
     which is extremly useful with an italian keyboard.

 * quotes:
   - Use double-quote character for both opening and closing quotes.

 * evenpage:
   - Ensure that the number of pages generated by "LaTeX" is an even number.

Besides the packages themselves, also the "makedoc" utility is available:
it is a UNIX shell-script that takes a ".dtx" file and extracts both the
".sty" file and the documentation (which is automatically compiled with LaTeX).
The script only works for ".dtx" files that are structured like my packages,
i.e. they must directly produce the style-file and a documentation-driver
(".drv") when simply run through LaTeX.

If you have any suggestions, find any bugs or make any improvment on any of
my packages, please let me know about it by sending an E-mail at the following
