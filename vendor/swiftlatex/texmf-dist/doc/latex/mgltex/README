This is the mglTeX package. It allows you to create high-quality
publication-ready graphics directly from MGL scripts embedded into your LaTeX
document, using the MathGL library (http://mathgl.sourceforge.net).
================================================================================

If the "mgltex.sty" file (the package itself) wasn't included with this
distribution, you can build it yourself executing:

    1. (pdf)latex mgltex.ins

If the "mgltex.pdf" file (the documentation) wasn't included with this
distribution, you can build it yourself executing the following steps:

    1. (pdf)latex mgltex.dtx
    2. makeindex -s gglo.ist -o mgltex.gls mgltex.glo
    3. makeindex -s gind.ist -o mgltex.ind mgltex.idx
    4. (pdf)latex mgltex.dtx

Steps 2 and 3 are optional, and are only for the creation of an index and a
glossary.

The file "sample.pdf" is intended as a tiny sample of the capabilities of
mglTex and MathGL, as well as a brief introduction to the package. You can use
it as an alternative documentation if you want to start using the package right
away. If the file wasn't included with this distribution, you can build it with
the following steps:

    1. Run '(pdf)latex sample.tex' to create the MGL scripts
		2. Compile the produced .mgl scripts with mglconv (part of MathGL)
		3. Run '(pdf)latex sample.tex' a second time to include the graphics

Alternatively, you can run '(pdf)latex --shell-escape sample.tex' twice in
order to allow mglTeX to automatically call mglconv.
