The package jumplines provides an easy way of displaying (newspaper) articles or non-floating
content, break it at some specified height, continue it later on and have forward and backward
links to it.

Since breaks can happen inside of coloured content, currently only lualatex provides the correct
colour maintenance of the broken boxes.
