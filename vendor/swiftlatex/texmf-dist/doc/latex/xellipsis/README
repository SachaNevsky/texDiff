This work consists of the files xellipsis.ins and
xellipsis.dtx, along with derived files xellipsis.sty and
xellipsis.pdf.

The xellipsis package provides a system for configuring
(almomst) every possible aspect of ellipses, including
preceding and proceeding characters; the character itself;
distances before and after each of these; and number of
characters.  It comes with both a compatibility option for
standard LaTeX \ldots as well as preset package options for
the Chicago Manual of Style (Turabian); the Bluebook; and
MLA guidelines.

This package should run properly on any properly running LaTeX
system.
