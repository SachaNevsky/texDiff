New features and bug corrections are described in the file 3.000-release-notes.

The documentation (only available in french) is provided in file 
lettre.tds.zip/doc/latex/lettre/lettre.pdf.

Installation
============
Installation is very simple, the only sensitive files are lettre.cls and
default.ins which are to be put in the macro path, usually hidden behind the
environment variable $TEXINPUTS.


Please proceed as follows:

	1) extract the file tree from the compressed archive lettre.tds.zip and put it
	   under the ${TEXINPUTS} directory, where ${TEXINPUTS} denotes the TDS tree
	   targeted for installation.


	2) refresh your file name data base (Under MiKTeX click on
	  "refresh FNDB" button in the administation pannel)
	
Usage
=====
Print, then follow the documentation. The examples give real letter and telefax
source codes that are compiled with the class along with the PDF output included
as a picture in the manual. Try to compile them to check the package against
your LaTeX installation.
