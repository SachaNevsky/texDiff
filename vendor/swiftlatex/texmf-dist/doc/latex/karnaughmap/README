KARNAUGHMAP is a LaTeX package used to draw Karnaugh maps.

It got inspired by the karnaugh macros provided at https://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/karnaugh.

It offers an easy to use key-value interface, based on the input of an ordered truth table.
Intended for educational purposes, it allows to customize the fields of the Karnaugh map (e.g. by enumerating the fields).

For details see the package documentation.
