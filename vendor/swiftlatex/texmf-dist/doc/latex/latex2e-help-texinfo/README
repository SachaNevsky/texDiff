README for latex2e.texi, aka the latex2e-help-texinfo package.
Public domain.  This README file originally written 2008, Karl Berry.

This project is an attempt to write a reference manual for core LaTeX.
It is unofficial and the LaTeX Project members have not reviewed it.

https://puszcza.gnu.org.ua/software/latexrefman/ (the project home page)
has more information, including links to the current output in various
formats, sources, mailing lists, and other infrastructure.

We offer two web versions of the manual.  A version that is split
into separate web pages for each section or subsection is here.
  https://latexref.xyz
We also have a single-page version. 
  http://latexref.xyz/dev/latex2e.html

Help is most definitely wanted.  (Search for "xx" in the source for just
a few of the known deficiencies.)  Please email any bug reports, new
material, general discussion, whatever, to latexrefman@tug.org (see
http://lists.tug.org/latexrefman for archives and subscription via the web).
