This is the README file for the options package.

VERSION

Version 1.0, December 2015

SUMMARY

Provices convenient key-value options for LaTeX package writers.

It has a similar interface as `pgfkeys` with path options but comes with more
built-in data types and more convenient support for families and searching.
The main features of the `options` pckage are:

* Declare your options only once: in most packages you usually need to
  declare both a new command, and the option that sets it. In the
  `options` package you declare the option just once. For example,
    
      \options{/my/len/.new length} 

  and then use it anywhere else as
      
      \option{/my/len}

* _Use paths for keys_: just like `pgfkeys`, the `options` package uses
  paths (instead of families) to declare options and prevent name clashes
  between different packages. Paths are convenient for complex options,
  like `border/left/width`, and are also convenient to specify searches.

* _Many built-in data types_: the `options` library comes with many
  useful data types like `choice`, `list`, `toggle`, `num`, `dim`,
  `length`, `glue`, commands, and plain values, and it is easy to add
  your own. Also you can hook into existing definitions like an `if` or `counter`.

* _Value options_: You can define value-only options that start with a
  special character, like `"Georgia"` for a font option, or 
  `!8080FF` for a color option. 

* _Convenient searches_: you can specify paths that should be searched
  from other paths and redirect even from absolute paths. For complex
  packages this is very useful to inherit common options.

* _Easy filtering_: it is easy to collect unknown options and process
  them later. Combined with the search mechanism this makes it easy to 
  do custom processing.

* _It is fast_: for simple user options, the &options; package is a bit
  faster than `pgfkeys` and if searches or filters are involved it is
  usually about twice as fast as `pgfkeys` (and about six times faster
  as `xkeyval`).

* _Handles class and package options_: use the same option declarations
  to handle the options passed to a class or package.
