The regexpatch package generalizes the macro patching commands
provided by P. Lehmann's `etoolbox'. The difference between this
package and its sibling `xpatch' is that this package sports a very
powerful `\regexpatchcmd' based on the `l3regex' module of LaTeX3
experimental packages.

This version fixes a silly typo introduced in version 0.2c

This is version 0.2d of the package (a maintainance release)
