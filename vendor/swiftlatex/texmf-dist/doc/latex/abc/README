language (http://abcplus.sourceforge.net).

This is version 2.0b of the package (a maintenance release)

 This work has the LPPL maintenance status "author-maintained".

 This work consists of the following files:

README (this file)
abc.dtx
abc.ins
abc.pdf

 and of the derived files

abc.sty
mup.sty
example.tex
poll.abc
mupexa.tex
simple.mup

To install the distribution:

o run "latex abc.ins"
o run "latex -shell-escape example.tex" for a test
o move "abc.sty" and "mup.sty" to locations where LaTeX will
  find it (the FAQ on CTAN in /help/uktug-FAQ gives more
  information about this magic place)

Please note that you need, on your system, the
utilities "abcm2ps" (http://abcplus.sourceforge.net),
either "ps2eps" (which comes with TeX Live) or "ps2epsi"
(which comes with Ghostscript), and epstopdf (which
comes with TeX Live) if you use pdflatex.

If you want to compile the Mup examples, you need the
utility "mup" (http://www.arkkra.com), along with the
Postscript utilities mentioned above.

Note also that you must enable "shell escape" on your
TeX system via the command line switch (at least); see
your distribution's documentation. However, this is not
strictly necessary in order to use the package, see the
documentation.
