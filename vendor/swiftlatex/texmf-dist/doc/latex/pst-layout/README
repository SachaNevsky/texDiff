This package contains macros which may be useful in preparing quasi-tabular material based on pstricks packages. It is intended to be used for preparation of a single such item such as a stand-alone document like a menu page, business card, brochure page or page of a program. Little knowledge of pstricks macros is required for basic usage, but note that only LaTeX is supported.
