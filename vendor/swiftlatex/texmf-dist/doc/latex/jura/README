README to accompany the jura package by Felix Braun.

jura implements the rules usually used in typesetting term papers at
German law schools. Please note that the author did not supply a user
guide in English as users outside the German legal profession will
hardly need the package. So if you process jura.dtx with LaTeX you
will get a user guide and package documentation in German only.
