The Current Maintainer of this work is Mike Kaufmann.

This work consists of the files notespages.dtx and notespages.ins
and the derived files notespages.sty and np-test.tex.


1. What is it
The NotesPages package provides one macros to insert a single notes page and
another to fill the document with multiple notes pages, until the total number
of pages (so far) is a multiple of a given number. A third command can be used
to fill half empty pages with a notes area.

This package is in a nearly finished state of development (it's version 0.8).
It is useful, but there are some restrictions. And although it's not planned,
the user interface may change in the future.


2. Generating notespages.sty
Simply run:    tex notespages.ins

The file notepages.dtx also contains an example. You will be asked,
if you want to generate it.


3. Making the Documentation
To get contents, cross references and index right, run TeX and makeindex
as follows:

pdflatex notespages.dtx
pdflatex notespages.dtx
makeindex -s gind.ist notespages.idx
makeindex -s gglo.ist -o notespages.gls notespages.glo
pdflatex notespages.dtx


4. Making the Example File
To get it right, run LaTeX twice. It requires KOMA-Script and TikZ.
Oh, and it takes quite some time to compile.
