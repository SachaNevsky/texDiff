DESCRIPTION
===========

 The mattens package contains the definitions to typeset vectors
 and tensors as used in the engineering community for the
 representation of common vectors and tensors such as forces,
 velocities, moments of inertia, etc.

 This package adheres to the well-defined and documented notation
 as proposed by Hassenpflug:.

FILES IN DISTRIBUTION
=====================

   BASE DISTRIBUTION:

      readme.txt   This file.
      mattens.ins  Package installation file.
      mattens.dtx  Package source file.

      mattens.sty  Package style file. It was produced by
                   executing "latex mattens.ins". Please note
                   that mattens.sty requires the amsmath
                   package.

   DOCUMENTATION:

      mattens_sample.pdf
      mattens_sample.tex A sample document that describes the tensor
                         notation itself in mode detail. It shows some
                         of the applications of the vector/tensor
                         notation.

BASIC INSTALLATION
====================

   The minimum requirement to use the package is the to have
   mattens.sty in a directory where TeX can find it.

   For a basic installation on a TDS compliant system, move the
   following files to the following directories:

     <texmf>/tex/latex/mattens/
        mattens.sty

     <texmf>/source/latex/mattens/
         mattens.ins
         mattens.dtx

     <texmf>/doc/latex/mattens/
         readme
         mattens.pdf
         mattens_sample.pdf
         mattens_sample_src.zip
