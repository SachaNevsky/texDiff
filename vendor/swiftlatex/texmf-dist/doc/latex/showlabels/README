Showlabels
==========

Put the names of `\labels` and other commands into the margins of a draft
document.

Version 1.8, 2016 June 9, http://purl.org/nxg/dist/showlabels.

This class option helps you keep track of all the labels in your
documents, by putting the name of the new label into the margin
whenever either the `\label` command is used, or an equation is
automatically numbered. It is compatible with the amsmath and hyperref
packages.

It is similar to, but does a little more than, the showkeys package.

You invoke this package with the command `\usepackage{showlabels}` in the
preamble. You can control where the labels appear -- in the margins or
in the interline gaps -- and you can change the appearance of the
formatted labels to some extent.

As well, you can have the arguments to other commands besides `\label`
displayed. This is fairly obviously useful for the `\cite` command, but
it can be useful for `\ref` or `\begin` as well.

The source code for the package is maintained at
[bitbucket.org](https://bitbucket.org/nxg/showlabels).  This site
includes an issue tracker, where you can report bugs (or just mail me).
