The "overlays" LaTeX package (version 2.10)
-------------------------------------------

The "overlay" package allows to write presentations with dynamic slides. It does
not presuppose any specific document class. Rather, it is a lightweight
alternative to full-fledged presentation classes like "beamer".

The package requires the following packages: "xcolor", "environ", and "pgffor"
(part of "pgf").

It is released 'as is' with no warranty under the LaTeX Project Public License,
version 1.3c [1].
