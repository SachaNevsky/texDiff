Description
===========

This package implements a LaTeX command that converts an amsrefs
bibliographical database (.ltb) to a BibTeX bibliographical database
(.bib).

The typical usage is to run LaTeX on a document such as

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{ltb2bib}
\begin{document}
\writebib{bblsource}{bibdest}
\end{document}

This will convert the bibliographical entries in bblsource.ltb to
BibTeX format, and write them to bibdest.bib.

ltb2bib is the reverse of the "amsxport" option in amsrefs. Typical uses are:

* produce bib entries for some publishers which don't accept amsrefs
  (Taylor & Francis, for example);

* import an ltb database in a database management program, e.g. for sorting;

* access one's ltb database within emacs's RefTeX mode.
