DSPTricks (with DSPFunctios and DSPBlocks)
v1.0 - July 2014

(c) Paolo Prandoni, 2014, paolo.prandoni@epfl.ch

The package DSPTricks is a set of LaTeX macros 
(based on PSTricks) for plotting the kind of graphs 
and figures that are usually employed in digital 
signal processing publications. DSPTricks provides 
facilities for standard discrete-time "lollipop" plots, 
continuous-time and frequency plots, and pole-zero plots. 
The companion package DSPFunctions provides macros
to compute frequency responses and DFTs, while the 
package DSPBlocks supports DSP block diagrams.
