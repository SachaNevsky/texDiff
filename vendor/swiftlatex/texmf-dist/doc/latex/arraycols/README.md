This small package provides new column types for array and tabular environments,
horizontally and vertically centered,
or with adjusted height for big mathematical expressions.

The columns width can be fixed or calculated like in tabularx environments.
Macros for drawing vertical and horizontal rules of variable thickness are also provided.
