  PSIZZL COMMANDS - reference manual
 
             Reference guide to Psizzl macros
 This is a list of all the user macros in Psizzl.
 They are grouped logically according to function.
 
MACROS
 
These macros are general-purpose macros used
everywhere in Psizzl, or are of general interest.
    \Psizzl - this gives the logo: Psizzl
    \diagnostics - turns on tracing diagnostics

    \underscore#1 -
       gives the argument, \underscore{{\it underscored}}

    \centertitle#1 - along with |\breaktitle|, below, gives a centered
       title, whose line breaks are controlled by the user
    \breaktitle - to be used with |\centertitle| to break the lines
    \monthdayyear - causes the date used in \Psizzl macros to appear
       as {\sl ``month day, year''}, instead of {\sl ``day month year''},
       which is the default.
    \date#1 - sets the date to the argument. See also  |\letterdate| and
          |\pubdate|.
    \loosepar - To be used to terminate any paragraph which
       has an overfull |\hbox|, due to the line breaker not working.

       may be used in macro names.
    \lock - To undo |\unlock|.

    \translate#1#2#3 - causes TeX to typeset the object specified by #3
       at the postion specified by X = #1 and Y = #2 relative to the
       current postion. The current position is not, however, changed.

CITATION
Citations such as references, figures, tables and equations are
done by these macros.
 
In the following macros,
#1 is a valid TeX control squence name
(`\' followed by alphabetic characters only: don't use any numerals!).
 
Where the macros use `=', they are defining the mnemonic name, so
\<NAME> must not have been previously defined. (Hint: use some CAPITALS).
Once this has been done, the mnemonic name can be used with the macro
without the `=' and following one (or three) arguments:
e.g.: first use: `\cite\DrellYan={Private communication}'
      second use: `\Reference\DrellYan\ has clearly shown....'
 
In the reference, equation, and author address macros,
#2 is the text of the respective thing being defined.
 
    REFERENCES:
    The following three macros set the style of the reference:
    \superreference - References will be superscripted: `$^{#1}$'
    \bracketreference - References will appear in brackets: `[#1]'
    \parenreference - References will appear in parenthesis: `(#1)'
 
    The following five macros define or cite references:
    \cite#1=#2 - Define a new reference and put out, e.g.: `$^{#1}$'
    \hideref#1=#2 - define a new reference, but don't put out any text.
       This is how multiple references are produced.
    \bareref#1=#2 - define a new reference, and put out #1 only (bare).
    \reference#1=#2 - Define a new reference and put out `Ref.#1'
    \Reference#1=#2 - Define a new reference and put out `Reference #1'
 
    \refspec#1,#2(#3)
        Specify a reference in a way that the journal style can switch.
    \volyearpageref - |\refspec| will be: volume, year, page.
    \cernref - References will appear in CERN's style.
 
    EQUATIONS:
    \equation#1=#2 - Define a new equation.
    \Equation#1=#2 - Define a new equation.
    \display#1=#2  - define a new equation and display it.

    In the figure and table macros,
    #2 is the title of the figure or table, which will appear in the
    table of contents.
    #2 and #3 concatenated together constitute the caption of the figure
    or table.
    #4 will be the contents of the figure or table itself.
 
    FIGURES:
    \figure#1=#2#3#4 - Define a new figure and put out `Fig.#1'
    \Figure#1=#2#3#4 - Define a new figure and put out `Figure #1'
    \iffigureembed - figures are to be imbedded into the text.
       Default: true.
 
    TABLES:

    \Table#1=#2#3#4 - Define a new table and put out `table #1'
    \iftableembed - tables are to be embedded into the text.
       Default: true.
 
    MISC:
    \hangpar#1#2 - starts a paragraph with hanging indentation.
    \lowercasecite - Citations will be lower case, not upper.
    \vita#1 - specify a curriculum vitae for this document
    \hyphen - punctuation for equations and multiple references

They can each turn into a ``silent'' index entry by doubling the `^'
   ^\{text} - Ordinary index entry.
