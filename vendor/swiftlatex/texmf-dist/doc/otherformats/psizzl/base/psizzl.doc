PSIZZL DOC - introduction to Psizzl macros for TeX version 1.1
 
This disk contains the TeX macro package PSIZZL.
It is to be used in conjunction with Tex82 ver. 1.1
 
To use these macros,
prepare a TeX input file of filetype `TEX',
and give the (CMS) command `TEX &PSIZZL <filename>',
where <filename> is the name of your file.
 
You may want to make a file called MYPSIZZL TEX,
which would have your customized Psizzl macros on it.
A dummy version of this file is provided.
 
The file `PSIZZL ARCHLIST' contains a listing of all the distribution
Psizzl files.
 
A file `PSIZZL COMMANDS' gives a listing of the user commands in Psizzl,
along with a discussion of how to use them.
 
Models (templates) for various types of jobs, such as letters, memos,
papers, reports, theses, chapters, lists, figures, tables, and references
may be found in the files `* TEMPLATE'.
These files may be edited directly into Psizzl input files.
Note the file `PSIZZL TEMPLATE', which shows how to
surround your file with the appropriate commands to run it.
 
For CMS systems, there are two REXX exec files which, respectively
carry on a dialog with the user to build Psizzl letters and memos.
In addition, there is a file called `PSIZBILD' which builds the
PSIZZL FMT file.
 
A document describing these macros, ``Psizzl Macros'' is available
as SLAC-REPORT-268 from the author,
Arthur Ogawa, CLA B226, Bin 96, SLAC, Stanford, CA 94305,
(415) 854-3300 X2698,
vmid `OGAWA' at `SLACVM' on net `BITNET'.
Future releases of Psizzl will have this paper online.
 
Any problems, questions, suggestions for improvements, etc.
should be sent to Ogawa.
