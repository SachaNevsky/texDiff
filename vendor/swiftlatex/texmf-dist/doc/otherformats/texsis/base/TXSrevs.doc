\appendix{B}{Revisions}

      This appendix lists the major changes in \TeXsis\ as new versions
have come out.  It is organized by sections of the manual and is
intended as a guide for users familiar with the previous version. There
are many smaller changes in addition to those listed here.

\subsection{Revisions for Version 2.18 \label{rev.2.18}}

The most noticable change is that as of version 2.18 the distribution
of \TeXsis\ is covered by the \LaTeX\ Project Public License (LPPL).
\TeXsis\ has been an ``open source'' software project since it was
started in 1988, but we finally found that we had to be more explicit
about the licensing, to give proper assurances that it could indeed be
distributed freely.  After considering several options we found that
the the LPPL suited the needs and the spirit of \TeXsis\ most closely.

  Please note that the LPPL only applies to the \TeXsis\ source code and
code derived from it, but it does not apply to \TeXsis\ style files
(or other files) which were written independently
without using \TeXsis\ source code.  We hope that the authors of style
files will choose to follow our lead and license their works under the
LPPL, but they are free to choose whatever license they deem
appropriate. 

Two patches were released for \TeXsis~2.17 to fix minor problems,
and these have been incorporated into the current release.

The default installation directory has been changed 
to |/usr/local/texmf| in the |Makefile| to conform to the recommendations of the \TeX\
Directory Structure (TDS).  You can, of course, easily change this by
editing the |Makefile| before you install \TeXsis.  This change has
not yet been made in the installation instructions.

\bigskip

\Sect{start}
Some common \LaTeX\ opening instructions are now detected and a
warning message given.  Thus if you try to run a \LaTeX\ file through
\TeXsis\ you'll be given a little more help in figuring out your mistake.

\Sect{refs}
Different citation styles are now available by different names,
and new ones (\cs{CiteByFootnote}, \cs{CiteByAuthor},
\cs{CiteByTag}) have been added.   

This section of the manual has been broken into separated into
subsections to make it easier to read.
Documentation was added for \cs{ArticleTitle} and for BibTeX.

A bug in \cs{ListReferences} was fixed, and the formatting
adjusted for the new citation styles.  \cs{CiteByFootnote} is now
correctly syncronized to the same counter used by \cs{NFootnote}.


\Sect{sects}
Documentation was added for setting \cs{ChapterTitle},
\cs{SectionTitle}, and \cs{SubsectionTitle}.

A rare problem that appears when there are a large number of floating
insertions was fixed. 

\Sect{headline}
The \cs{bottompagenumbers} macro just puts the page number at the
bottom of the page, but doesn't surround it by dashes.
The number produced by \cs{PageNumber} will now always appear in
|\rm| type.


\Sect{color}
The \cs{ListColors} macro was added.

An example is now given in the manual showing how to automatically
have every displayed equation printed in color, using |\PushColor| and
|\aftergroup\PopColor|.

\Sect{form}
The file |TXSform.tex| has been renamed |Formletr.txs|, making this
less-used feature a style file rather than a part of the core \TeXsis\
macros. 

\Sect{dcol}
The bottom insertions code has been moved to the file |TXSdcol.tex| so
that it can be used with Plain \TeX\ by inputing that file by itself.


%-----------------------------------------------------------------------*
\subsection{Revisions for Version 2.17 \label{rev.2.17}}

Most of the changes are internal, and won't be noticed by most users.
But there are also a few major useful additions, such as \BibTeX\ support.

\Sect{fonts}
One can now use \cs{scr} in subscripts and superscripts.

\Sect{symb}
Added symbols \CS{sun} and \CS{earth} for astronomical symbols
\sun\ and \earth.

\Sect{refs}
Added support for \BibTeX.
Reference counters and files are reset so that you can go on to
collect more references (as for separate chapters in a book).
Many internal improvements to the referencing macros.

\Sect{labels}
The format of the |.aux| file has changed, and now matches more
closely the format used by \LaTeX.
This allows it to be used with packages like \BibTeX.
If you have problems with an old |.aux| file, just delete it.
A new one will be created when you process the document again.

\Sect{sects}
First paragraph of a chapter, section or subsection is not indented.

\Sect{fmts}
Added {\tt color.txs} macros to change the colors of PostScript output.
These macros should be backward compatible with {\tt colordvi.sty}.
 
\Sect{letr}
The letter writing macros can now print envelopes.
The form letter macros have moved to a style file, {\tt Formletr.txs} 

\Sect{memo}
Added \cs{faxmemo} and \cs{FAX}.

\Sect{misc}
Fixed \cs{undertext}.  \cs{spine} has moved to a style file, {\tt
spine.txs}, but it auto-loaded from it, so the user shouldn't notice
the difference.


%-----------------------------------------------------------------------*
\subsection{Revisions for Version 2.16          \label{rev.2.16}}
We created a single file |mtexsis.tex| which can be used for
processing \TeXsis\ e-prints and other documents if you have not
installed \TeXsis.

\Sect{fonts}
Added \cs{NFootnotes} to produce automatically numbered footnotes.

\Sect{eqns}
Added a number of useful symbols.  Removed the raised |\zeta| and
|\chi|, which caused trouble in some contexts.

\Sect{refs}
Improved the treatment of spacing for reference numbers and for
multiple citations.  

\Sect{papers}
Reorganized the documentation so that document formats, the title
page, chapters and sections, running headlines, the table of contents,
and the index are all described together here.

\Sect{sects}
Fixed spacing and hyphenation for long section titles.

\Sect{sects}
Changed default value of \cs{sectionskip} and \cs{subsectionskip},
so they are not quite so big.

\Sect{conts}
The page numbers for full-page tables and figures were wrong in the
table of contents; this has been corrected.

\Sect{conts}
\cs{Contentstrue} and \cs{Contentsfalse} turn on and off the table of
contents. The old |\ContentsSwitchtrue| is obsolete but still works.

\Sect{figures}
Figures and tables can now be inserted at the bottom of a page 
with \cs{bottominsert} or \cs{heavyinsert}.

\Sect{figures}
\cs{ListFigureCaptions} allow you to print the figure captions at the
end of a document.

\Sect{figures}
In the previous version the obsolete \cs{Tablebody} was moved to a style
file called |Tablebody.txs|.  The name of this file has been changed to
|Tablebod.txs| so that it can be used on a DOS PC.

\Sect{fmts}
Added \cs{PhysRevManuscript} style for manuscripts to be submitted to
the {\sl Physical Review}, and \cs{PhysRev} and
\cs{PhysRevLett} styles emulating the appearance of those journals.
These are in the style files |PhysRev.txs|.
Revised the |\IEEE| and |\WorldScientific| styles to follow those
formats more closely.  Moved twin page output to a style file.

\Sect{fmts}
Changed the method of loading site and style files so that they work
even with OZ\TeX\ on a Macintosh.

\Sect{dcol}
Extensively revised the double column macros.  They now support
insertion of figures at the bottom of the page or of a column, allow
figures to flow from one column to the next, and allow footnotes. The
new version is backwards compatible except for the names of the
headline and footline offsets, and can also be used by itself with Plain
TeX. 

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------*
\subsection{Revisions for Version 2.15 \label{rev.2.15}}%
An index has been added to the manual, using the index making macros
of |index.tex| and the MakeIndex program.  We have included |index.tex|
in the standard distribution of \TeXsis, but the only documentation at
present is that contained in the source file.

\Sect{intro}
Added a separate file called |Example.tex| which contains a short
example physics paper which uses the \TeXsis\ macros.

\Sect{fonts}
Support added for \cs{scr} using Ralph Smith's Formal Script fonts,
assuming that they are available.

\Sect{fonts}
Added \cs{Footnote} to act like \cs{footnote} but with the text
of the footnote singlespaced and in 10\pt\ type. (The font
can be changed by changing \cs{FootFont}.)

\Sect{refs}
Modified \cs{reference}, \cs{cite}, etc., to insert extra space after
a reference following the end of a sentence.

\Sect{sects} 
Added \cs{pagecheck} to \cs{section} and \cs{subsection}, etc. These
macros skip to to a new page if less than \cs{sectionminspace} space
is left on the page.  The initial setting for \cs{sectionminspace} is
|0.25\vsize|. Also made the skips before the titles of sections and
subsections variables \cs{sectionskip} and \cs{subsectionskip} in
place of the previous fixed values.

\Sect{fmts}
The definition of \cs{thesis} has been moved to the style file
|thesis.txs| so that it is easier to make local changes.
The \cs{thesis} command automatically loads from this file.

\Sect{fmts}
Added the style file |PhysRev.txs| containing a definition of
\cs{PhysRev} for a Physical Review format.  A page proof layout 
should be available in the future.

\Sect{figures}
Added |epsf.tex| to the standard \TeXsis\ distribution and included
documentation for \cs{epsfbox} and related macros.

\Sect{figures}
The macros for making lists of figures and tables have been improved
(along the lines of the new table of contents macros).

\Sect{letr}
Modified \cs{formletters} to have a complete \cs{letterhead} macro or
even more complicated things as one of the arguments, rather than just
the phone number. This allows you to create more complicated
letterheads.  Note also that the order of arguments is now reversed from
what it was previously!  The first argument is the \cs{letterhead} stuff
(it gets done {\sl before} the address) and the second argument is the
name of the text file (it controls what is printed {\sl after} the
address.

\Sect{dcol}
Introduced \cs{longequation} and \cs{endlongequation} for equations
which span both columns.  The definitions of these can vary from style
to style, so they may or may not include a \cs{leftcolrule} and 
\cs{rightcolrule}.

\Sect{misc}
Added this section to the manual to explain miscellaneous useful macros
which don't fit anywhere else.

\Sect{misc}
Added \cs{Ignore} and |\endIgnore| to ignore large blocks of text.
This is slightly more clever than |\comment|, which remains available.



%-----------------------------------------------------------------------*
\subsection{Revisions for Version 2.14 \label{rev.2.14}}
\smallskip
\Sect{fonts}
\cs{TrueDoubleSpacing} generates a document with 2 times the normal
spacing, in contrast to \cs{doublespaced}, which gives 1.5 times the
normal spacing.

\Sect{eqns}
Fixed a bug in \cs{bordermatrix}.

\Sect{refs}
An error which occurred if \cs{endreference} was followed by
additional text on the same line has been fixed.

\Sect{refs}
Extra space is now inserted after a reference number which follows a
period.

\Sect{refs}
\cs{refrange} can now be used with \cs{reference} or \cs{cite}; the
correct numbers and ranges separated by commas are printed.

\Sect{envmt}
The internal spacing mechanism for environments has been modified to
work with arbitrary \cs{baselineskip} and \cs{parskip} values. Some minor
changes have been made to the center and flush environments.

\Sect{envmt}
The \cs{Listing} environment has been modified so that the characters 
|{} % & () $ #| and~{\tt \VT} are just ordinary printable characters and
so that |\\| gives a printed |\|.

\Sect{envmt}
|\@startenv| and |\@endenv| to begin and end environments have been
replaced with \cs{begEnv} and \cs{endEnv}, which are accessible to the
user because the do not have |@| in their names.

\Sect{ruled}
The \cs{ruledtable} macros can now use \cs{tabskip} glue to produce a
table of arbitrary width. Spacing of the tables has been improved and
made more robust.

\Sect{sects}
|\addsectioncont| has been replaced with \cs{addTOC}, i.e., "add to
Table Of Contents." The new macro is simpler and produces
better-looking output.

\Sect{sects}
Spacing such as \cs{singlespaced} placed after the \cs{texsis}
initialization now sets the spacing for the entire document; the
explicit spacing commands in \cs{abstract}, etc., have been removed.

\Sect{sects}
A macro \cs{setSectionID} has been added to allow one to place a figure
or table for one section in a different section if necessary and still
get the correct number. 

\Sect{fmts}
The \cs{NorthHolland} format now gives the more common single-column
North-Holland/Elsevier format. \cs{NorthHollandTwo} produces the
previous double-column oversized format. \cs{Manuscript} produces a
preprint with true double spacing as requested by The Physical Review.

\Sect{fmts}
\cs{endtitle}, \cs{endauthor}, etc., can now be omitted from the titlepage
material, since \cs{title}, \cs{author}, etc., now close the previous mode
automatically.

\Sect{letr}
Letters and memos can now be ended with \cs{bye}.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------*
\pagecheck{0.2\vsize}
\subsection{Revisions for Version 2.13 \label{rev.2.13}}%
\smallskip

\Sect{fonts}
Italic fonts are now available in large sizes, e.g. for \cs{slides}. Math
italic bold fonts have been added for titles.

\Sect{eqns}
By default parentheses and brackets are now ordinary characters except
in math mode and so can be used, e.g., in file names. As a result,
automatic sizing of parentheses works only in {\sl displayed\/} equations. You
can restore the old behavior by saying |\onparens| at the beginning of
the document.

\Sect{refs}
The text for references is now written with \cs{unexpandedwrite}. In
practice this means that references can contain almost anything,
including a \cs{Ref}. 

\Sect{refs}
The \cs{journal} macro was added to make it easier to create standard
citations to journal articles, and to be able to switch between the
American and European styles.

\Sect{refs}
Superscript references are now in \cs{citestyle}, which is initially set
to \cs{scriptstyle} but can be changed.

\Sect{tbls} 
A way was created to save all figure and table insertions until the end
of the document with \cs{FiguresLast}, and then print them with 
\cs{PrintFigures}, and similarly for tables.

\Sect{fmts}
The \cs{NorthHolland} document layout was added to produce camera-ready
copy for Proceedings published by North-Holland/Elsevier.  This is a
double column format with titles left justified and eleven point type.

Saying \cs{singlespaced} immediately after \cs{texsis} or its equivalent
will now make the whole document single spaced.

\Sect{dcol}
The double column macros have been modified so that removing the
\cs{setdoublecolumns} will produce a single column document.

%----------------------------------------------------------------------*
\subsection{Revisions for Version 2.12 \label{rev.2.12}}%
\smallskip
\Sect{start} 
A new command \cs{texsis} performs the initialization, and calling it more
than once no longer causes an error. |\inittexsis| remains as a synonym.

\Sect{fonts} 
\cs{ninepoint}, \cs{twentypoint}, and \cs{twentyfourpoint} commands have been
added to select these sizes. The 9~pt.\ size is really too small for a
standard laser printer, but it is useful if you must print IEEE format
on $8.5\,{\rm in} \times 11\,{\rm in}$ paper. The large sizes are useful
for slides and other special purposes.

\Sect{tbls} 
The table and figure insertion macros has been extensively modified, and
the syntax has been changed. |\topTable|, etc., have been replaced by
|\table|, etc., which make the insertion and define the number for the
tag. |\Tbl| and |\Fig| use the number.  References to tables defined
later in the paper are satisfied using the |.aux| file, so
|\TOPTABLE|, etc., are no longer needed. The old names remain as
synonyms but their use is discouraged.

\Sect{tbls} 
\cs{ruledtable} and many associated macros have been added to make complex
ruled tables, including those with entries spanning more than one
column. |\Tablebody| is still available, but the new macros are much
more flexible and should be used instead.

\Sect{tbls} 
New macros have been added to list figures and tables.

\Sect{fmts} 
New formats have been added.  \cs{WorldScientific} and \cs{IEEEreduced} make
conference proceedings in World Scientific format and in IEEE format at
75\% of full size. \cs{referee} is based on the memo format and can be
used for referee reports. \cs{slides} uses large type to make
transparencies for overhead projectors and similar material.

\Sect{fmts} 
An \cs{authors} macro for papers with multiple authors and facilities for
putting footnotes on titles have been added.

\Sect{fmts} 
\cs{bookpagenumbers} causes odd page numbers to be placed in the upper
right corner and even ones in the upper left corner. Additional
information on headlines is given.

\Sect{letr} 
The form letter macros have been rewritten.  The syntax is the same
except that |\v| has been replaced by \cs{V} to avoid conflict with the
Plain \TeX\ accent. Also, \cs{V} now also works with \cs{formlabels}.

\Sect{letr} 
The new \cs{referee} format is described.

\Sect{dcol} 
The double column format has been extended to handle floating
insertions. \cs{topinsert} and \cs{pageinsert} produce insertions within a
column, while \cs{widetopinsert} and \cs{widepageinsert} produce insertions
across both columns.

\Sect{labels} 
The tagging mechanism has been changed to add an |@| before and after
the name. The practical effect is that using the name of a defined
control sequence like |book| for a tag no longer produces an error.
