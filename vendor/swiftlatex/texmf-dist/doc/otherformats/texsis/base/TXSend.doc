\noindent
\TeXsis\  began as a collection of macros used by
E.~Myers\reference{TeXsis-1.00}
E.~Myers,
\booktitle{\TeX sis Version 1.00} (unpublished)
\endreference
to typeset his Ph.D. thesis.\reference{Myers, 1984}
E.~Myers,
\booktitle{Calculation of the Gravitational Casimir Energy and Gauge Field
Couplings in Non-Abelian Kaluza-Klein Theories},
Ph.D.\  thesis (unpublished), Yale University, 1984
\endreference
These were in turn developed from a collection of macros
for creating technical reports known as \idx{TechRpt}.
We don't know for sure who wrote TechRpt, but the manual we used was
written by W.~Groppe\reference{Groppe}
W.~Groppe,
\booktitle{TechRpt} (unpublished)
\endreference
so he may be the author of the macros as well.

The original \BibTeX\  support, including {\tt texsis.bst}, was written
by Bernd Dammann.
