\section{Type Sizes, Type Styles, and Line Spacing      \label{sect.fonts}}

This section describes the \TeXsis\ commands for changing font sizes,
typestyles and the spacing between lines.  It also describes how you
can make footnotes, and a special feature for balancing quotation
marks.

\subsection{Type Sizes and Styles}

Plain \TeX\ is set up to use 10\pt\ type, with smaller sizes for
superscripts and subscripts.
\TeXsis\ expands the available type sizes to include 11, 12, 14, and
16\pt\ type, and \TeXsis\ makes it easy to change from one size of
type to another.
Type sizes are selected with the following commands:
\index{type sizes}%
\description{Xtwentyfourpointpoint\qquad} 
\itm{\CS{ninepoint}}
Gives 9 \pt\ type (not illustrated).
\itm{\CS{tenpoint} }
Gives {\tenpoint 10 \pt\ type, like this.} 
\itm{\CS{elevenpoint} }
Gives 11 \pt\ type. (not illustrated).
\itm{\CS{twelvepoint} }
Gives {\twelvepoint 12 \pt\ type, like this.} 
\itm{\CS{fourteenpoint} }
Gives {\fourteenpoint 14 \pt\ type, like this.} 
\itm{\CS{sixteenpoint} }
Gives {\sixteenpoint 16 \pt\ type, like this.} 
\itm{\CS{twentypoint}}
Gives 20 \pt\ type (not illustrated).
\itm{\CS{twentyfourpoint}}
Gives 24 \pt\ type (not illustrated).
\enddescription 
In some implementations of \TeX\ there is insufficient room to load
all of these fonts, so \idx{fonts} are loaded only when they are first
used, and not all of them can be illustrated here. 
\TeXsis\ starts out with \CS{tenpoint}, just like Plain \TeX, but
switches to \CS{twelvepoint} once you say \cs{texsis}.

In Plain \TeX\ you can switch between Roman, Bold, or Italic
typestyles with the commands \cs{rm}, \cs{bf}, and \cs{it}.
The same is true with \TeXsis.
These commands change the style of the type, but not the size.
The complete set of commands to change typestyles is:
\index{typestyles}%
\description{~rm~\qquad}
\itm{\cs{rm} }
Gives Roman type. Available in all sizes. 
\itm{\cs{it} }
Gives {\it italic type} for emphasis. Available in all sizes.
\itm{\cs{sl} }
Gives {\sl slanted type} for book titles, etc. Available in all sizes.
\itm{\cs{bf} }
Gives {\bf bold face type} for emphasis. Available in all sizes.
\itm{\cs{tt} }
Gives {\tt typewriter type} for listing computer programs, \TeX\
examples, etc.  Available in 10, 11, and 12~pt.
\itm{\CS{mib}}
Gives math italic bold in math mode (|$...$|) for titles. Available in
10, 11, 12, 14, 16, 20, and 24~pt base sizes, but the minimum size for
subscripts and superscripts is 10\pt.
\itm{\CS{scr}}
Gives script capital letters (using Ralph Smith's Formal Script fonts,
the |rsfs| fonts, if they are available on your computer).
Use |\scr| as you would use |\cal|.
\enddescription                                              
                                        
        \TeXsis\ includes the mathematics fonts in all sizes; these are
used automatically when you type equations between the math quotes,
|$...$|. Limited \idx{sans-serif fonts} are also available using the commands
\cs{tenss} and \cs{twelvess}.
         
        Two special symbols, \CS{Tbf} and \CS{tbf}, are used to produce
``\idx{Title bold face}'' and ``\idx{small title bold face}.''  The first is
used to print the title of a paper and titles of the chapters of a
paper, and the second is used to print the titles of sections of a
paper. You are free to change the definitions of these control words,
but if you do not they default to 14\pt\ boldface for \CS{Tbf} and 12\pt\ 
boldface for \CS{tbf}. 

      Math italic bold (\CS{mib}) is listed with the other fonts but
is actually slightly different: it substitutes boldfaced versions of
the math italic and math symbol fonts for the normal ones {\sl
everywhere\/} in math mode (|$...$|). These fonts are available only
with with Computer Modern fonts and only in 10\pt\ and larger sizes;
the standard math fonts are used for smaller superscripts. Since
\CS{mib} effectively redefines |$..$|, it must be placed before the
math material (i.e., outside the math quotes) and the whole formula
will be bold. For example,
\TeXexample
{\tbf\mib Observation of $Z^0 \to \mu^+\mu^-$}
|endTeXexample
will produce the indicated text in \CS{tbf} size with a bold formula,
provided you have the right fonts. The easiest way to find out is to try
it. Since the \CS{mib} fonts are not available everywhere,  they are never
loaded or used unless you explicitly ask for them.

        Plain \TeX\ includes a \idx{calligraphic script} font known as
\cs{cal}, but the letters in this font are not quite what most
physicists are accustomed to using for things like \idx{Lagrangian}
densities or \idx{functional measure}s.
Ralph Smith\index{Smith, Ralph} of U.C. San Diego has created a new
``\idx{formal script}'' font with much better letters for such
purposes, and \TeXsis\ supports this font provided that it is
available on your computer.
To get this new font you simply use \CS{scr} in place of \cs{cal}.
An example is:
\TeXexample
$$
   {\scr L} = - \del^\mu \phi^\ast \del_\mu \phi + m^2 \phi^2
$$
|endTeXexample
\noindent
Unfortunately, we don't know if your computer has the |rsfs|
fonts\index{rsfs font} so we won't try to show you the output from
this example.
The quickest way to determine whether the fonts are available on your
system is to try this example and verify that \TeX\ does not complain
about the font.
If your system does not have the font then you can obtain it from
CTAN, or from the \TeXsis\ ftp server.  (See the front cover of this
manual for instructions.)

\subsection{Interline Spacing} 

 When you use the macros \cs{tenpoint}, \cs{twelvepoint}, etc., the
style of the type is reset to Roman, as if you'd also typed \cs{rm}.  The
\idx{baseline skip} (the \idx{distance between lines}) is also set to be
suitable for the type size.
Several commands are provided that vary the interline spacing, both in
the text and in auxiliary material such as tables.
These are:
\description{~doublespaced~\qquad}\singlespaced\parskip=12pt
%
\itm{\CS{doublespaced}}
Makes the baseline skip 1.5 times its normal value.
True double spacing looks too wide with typesetting.
%
\itm{\CS{singlespaced} }
Resets the baseline skip to its normal value.
%
\itm{\CS{TrueDoubleSpacing}}
Makes the baselineskip twice its normal value.
This usually looks too wide for a final document, but it is desirable
in a manuscript being submitted to journals such as Physical Review.
%
\itm{\CS{triplespaced}}
Makes the baseline skip 3~times its normal value.
This should only be used for drafts of papers to leave room for notes
or corrections.
%
\itm{\CS{widenspacing}}
Increases the current spacing by a factor of 1.25.
With single spacing this is the analog of $1 {1\over2}$ spacing on a
typewriter.
Repeating |\widenspacing| increases the spacing by 1.25~times whatever
it already was; it does not reset the spacing to singlespaced first.
\enddescription
When \TeXsis\ is first started the default is |\singlespaced|, but once
it is initialized with the |\texsis| command (or |\preprint| or
|\paper|, etc...) the spacing is set to |\doublespaced|.

\subsection{Footnotes}

     Even when a paper is double spaced, you may want to have the
footnotes single spaced. Also, if the text is in 12~point type you may
nevertheless want to have the footnotes in 10~point type.
In \TeXsis\ you can do this easily using \CS{Footnote} in place of
\cs{footnote}, as in this example:\Footnote\dag{This is an example of
the use of {\tt\bs Footnote} in \TeXsis.}\index{footnotes}%
\TeXexample
... as in this example:\Footnote\dag{This is an example of 
the use of {\tt\bs Footnote} in \TeXsis.} 
|endTeXexample
\noindent
|\Footnote| also automatically puts the reference mark (in this case the
dagger symbol |\dag|) in a superscript.\Footnote{*}{The footnote
character is typeset in math mode, as if it were between two {\tt
\$}'s.}\ \
%
The typestyle used for the text of the footnote is
controlled by \CS{FootFont}, which defaults to:
\TeXexample
\def\FootFont{\tenpoint}
|endTeXexample 
\noindent
If you want to change this you can do so somewhere near the beginning of
your document.  The spacing between multiple paragraphs in a |\Footnote|
(if you are prone to being so verbose) is set to zero, regardless of the
\cs{parskip} in the main part of the document, but you can also change
this by adding \cs{parskip}|=|\meta{amount} to your new definition of
|\FootFont|.  If you want a singlespaced footnote in the |\FootFont|
typestyle but without putting a reference
mark in the text you can use
\CS{Vfootnote} just as you would use \cs{vfootnote} in Plain \TeX.  And
of course if |\Footnote| or |\Vfootnote| cannot do what you need even
after changing |\FootFont| then you can always use \cs{footnote} or
\cs{vfootnote} from Plain \TeX.%%
%
\Footnote{\ddag}{A technical footnote: With
|\footnote| from plain \TeX\ the group is closed before the footnote is
typeset, so any line spacing you set inside the footnote is lost. You
can solve this by putting a |\par| or |\vskip 0pt| at the end of your
footnote, but then the final strut is put on a separate line.  Getting
footnotes to work just right is tricky business, which is why we wrote
\CS{Footnote}.}

\bigskip

Sometimes it is desirable to have footnotes numbered consecutively.
This is easily done with \CS{NFootnote}, which keeps a count of the
footnotes it has created and uses the numbers for the reference marks.
Just as with \CS{Footnote}, the text is single spaced and printed in
the \CS{FootFont} typestyle.\NFootnote{This is an example of a
numbered footnote, which was created by saying ``|...printed in the
{\tt\bs FootFont} typestyle.\NFootnote{This is an example ... }|''}
The footnote counter is called \CS{footnum}, so if you want to start
over numbering footnotes (at the begining of a new chapter, for
example), then simply set this back to zero, by saying
\TeXexample
\footnum=0
|endTeXexample

\subsection{Automatic Quote Balancing}

One of the differences between typing and typesetting is the way in
which quote marks are handled.
On a typewriter you would simply use the non-oriented double-quote
mark (|"|) both to begin and end the quoted material.
In typesetting, however, quoted text begins with a left-quote mark
(``) and ends with a right-quote mark ('').
To produce these in \TeX\ you have to type two single-quote marks,
either |``| or |''|.
This is not very difficult to do, but unless you have an editing
program which does it for you, it is easy to forget and use the
double-quote marks instead.
With \TeXsis\ that's okay.
If you say\index{quote balancing}%
\example
\CS{quoteon}
\endexample
then the next time a double-quote mark comes along it will be
translated into a left-quote mark.
The double-quote mark after that will become a right-quote mark, and
so on, so that material enclosed in double-quote marks will be typeset
correctly.
All you have to do is remember to use the double-quote marks in pairs.
                 
        In some special cases you may not want \TeXsis\ to be so smart
about double-quotes.  You can turn this feature off by saying
\example      
\CS{quoteoff}
\endexample
The default though, once you have said |\texsis|, is |\quoteon|.
