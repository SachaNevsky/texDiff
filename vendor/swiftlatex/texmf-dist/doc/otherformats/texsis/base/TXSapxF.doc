\appendix{C}{Font Tables}
     
      The Computer Modern fonts that are used either by Plain \TeX\ or by
\TeXsis\ and the required sizes for each are listed in \Tbl{Fonts}. The
|cmmib10| and |cmbsy10| fonts may not exist in all installations, but
they will not be loaded unless \cs{mib} is used, so they are not required.
The command \CS{printfont}\arg{font} can be used to print a table of
the characters in any \meta{font}, e.g.,
\TeXexample
\printfont{cmr10}
|endTeXexample
A separate file called |Fonts.tex| is included with the standard
distribution of \TeXsis.  Running |Fonts.tex| through \TeXsis\ will
produce tables of all of the fonts used by your installation of \TeXsis.

      Most versions of \TeX\ now use ``CM'' (Computer Modern) fonts, but
some still use the older ``AM'' (Almost Modern) fonts. If you have
problems with the fonts, try editing |TXSfonts.tex|, replacing all
occurrences of |=cm| with |=am| and then recompiling \TeXsis. Mixing the
two types of fonts will produce errors.
