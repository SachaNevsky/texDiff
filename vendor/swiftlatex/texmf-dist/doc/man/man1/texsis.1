.SH NAME
TeXsis \- TeX macros for Physicists

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B texsis 
[ filename ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B TeXsis 
is a collection of 
.B TeX
macros for typesetting physics documents such as papers and preprints,
conference proceedings, books, theses, referee reports, letters, and
memos. 
.B TeXsis
macros provide automatic numbering of equations, automatic
numbering and formatting of references, double column formatting, macros
for making tables and figures, with or without captions, including
tables with horizontal and vertical rules.
.B TeXsis
supports a wide variety of type sizes and a number of
specialized document formats, and it even includes macros for making
form letters for job applications or letters of recommendation.
.PP
TeXsis is an extension of "plain" TeX, so anything you know how to do
in plain TeX you can do in TeXsis.
TeXsis macro instructions are simply abbreviations for often used
combinations of control sequences used to typeset physics documents.
For more information about plain TeX see the man pages for
.BR tex (1),
and/or 
.I The TeXbook, 
by D.E. Knuth.
.PP
TeXsis is stored as a pre-loaded format so that it loads quickly (see
the man pages for 
.BR initex (1),
and/or "preloaded formats" in 
.I The TeXbook
). 
To run TeXsis simply give the command 
.B texsis
in place of the 
.B tex
command, i.e.
.br
.sp
.in +2
.B texsis  
[ filename ]
.in -2
.br
.sp
where 
.I filename.tex 
is the name of a file containing TeX and/or TeXsis
\\controlsequences.
.PP
TeXsis is initally in plain TeX mode, i.e. 10pt type and singlespaced,
but the control sequence \\texsis selects 12pt type, doublespacing,
and enables other useful features.
Alternatively, \\paper turns on these features and sets things up to
typeset a paper, \\thesis does the same for typesetting a thesis,
\\letter is used to produce a letter using macros similar to those
listed in the back of
.I The TeXbook,
\\memo gives a setup for producing memoranda, and so on.
.PP
A manual which describes all of the TeXsis macro instructions is
available.
It is written in TeXsis, so it serves as its own example of how to
write a document with TeXsis.
The source code is also heavily commented, so it is possible to
extract useful macros from the source code and modify them to suit
your own purposes.
Provisions are made for local customization of TeXsis.
In particular, the file 
.I TXSmods.tex, 
if it exists, is read from the current directory or from the path
.B TEXINPUTS 
whenever TeXsis is started.
You can therefore put your own custom macros for a given project in a
directory and they will automatically be loaded when TeXsis is run
from that directory.

.SH INSTALLATION
There is an appendix to the printed manual containing detailed
installation instructions, but they are also provided in a form which
can be processed by plain TeX, in the file
.I Install.tex.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
TeXsis informational messages are written to the terminal and the log
file begining with `% '.
Warning and error messages begin with `> '.

.SH FILES
The source files for TeXsis and the TeXsis manual are usually installed  
in the same place the rest of TeX is kept.
Although this may vary from intallation to installation, it will
generally include a root directory named
.I texmf.  
Common examples are 
.I /usr/share/texmf/,
.I /usr/lib/teTeX/texmf,
or 
.I /usr/local/lib/texmf.
Filenames here are relative to this
.I texmf
root directory.
.br
.TP 2.5i
.I web2c/texsis.fmt
TeXsis pre-loaded format.
.TP 
.I tex/texsis/TXS*.tex
TeXsis source code.
.TP
.I tex/texsis/*.txs
"Style" files which can be read in at run time for special document
formats.
.TP
.I doc/texsis/TXS*.doc
Source for the printed TeXsis manual (written in TeXsis).
.TP
.I tex/texsis/TXSsite.tex
Local site customization instructions 
(this is read only once, when the format file is created).
.TP
.I tex/texsis/TXSpatch.tex
Run time patch file (like a system TeXsis.rc file, it is read
every time TeXsis is run).
.TP
.I TXSmods.tex
Run time init file (this is read every time TeXsis is run from the
current directory, or from the search path in 
.B TEXINPUTS
).

.SH RESTRICTIONS
Please note that TeXsis is designed to be completely compatible with
plain TeX.
As a result it cannot be compatible with LaTeX.
.PP
Having the full manual written in TeXsis can cause a problem if you
don't have a version of TeXsis already running.
To get around this you can run
.I Manual.tex 
through plain TeX and it will load the TeXsis files before processing
the manual.
This takes longer, but not by much.


.SH BUGS
Please report bugs (or suggestions for improvements) to  
texsis@feynman.physics.lsa.umich.edu.
.PP
Patchs to correct small problems or make small improvements
are available at 

        ftp://feynman.physics.lsa.umich.edu/texsis/

in the file 
.I TXSpatch.tex
(If that file doesn't exist then there are no current patches.)
