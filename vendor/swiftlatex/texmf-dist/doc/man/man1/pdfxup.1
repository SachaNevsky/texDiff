.SH NAME
pdfxup \- n-up tool with reduced margins
.SH SYNOPSIS
pdfxup [OPTIONS] [FILE]
.SH DESCRIPTION
pdfxup creates a PDF document where each page is obtained by combining
several pages of a PDF file given as output. The important feature of
pdfxup, compared to similar programs, is that it tries to compute the
(global) bounding box of the input PDF file, in order to remove the
margins and to keep the text only. Instead of having the font size
divided by 2 (for the case of 2-up output), in some case you may end up
with almost the same font size as in the original document (as is the
case for a default 'article' document produced by LaTeX).

pdfxup uses ghostscript for computing the maximal bounding box of (some
of) the pages of the document, and then uses pdflatex (with graphicx
package) in order to produce the new document.
.SH OPTIONS
pdfxup accepts numerous options. The most important ones are:
.\" additional options should be lister here...
.TP
\fB\-x\fR n, \fB\-\-columns\fR n
sets the number of columns in the output file (default 2);
.TP
\fB\-y\fR n, \fB\-\-rows\fR n
sets the number of lines in the output file (default 1);
.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-landscape\fR
sets orientation of paper (of final document) landscape;
.TP
\fB\-b\fR (le|se), \fB\-\-booklet\fR (le|se)
configure for printing as a booklet. Value 'le' (which is the default
value when \fB\-b\fR is used with no argument) means that two-sided
printing is in 'long-edge' mode (you turn from one page to the next
along the long edge of the paper). 'se' is the 'short-edge' option.
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-clip\fR
clip pages to the computed bounding box. By default, content is not
clipped, which may result in overlap of neighbouring pages. With this
option, anything outside the bounding box will not be displayed.
.TP
\fB\-o\fR file, \fB\-\-output\fR file
name of output file;
.TP
\fB\-i\fR
ask before overwriting output file;
.TP
\fB\-fw\fR d, \fB\-\-framewidth\fR d
width of the frame around each page (default 0.4pt). Set to 0pt to have no
frame at all;
.TP
\fB\-im\fR d, \fB\-\-innermargins\fR d
inner margin between frame and page (default 5pt);
.TP
\fB\-m\fR d, \fB\-\-margins\fR d
margin of pages of the new document (default 5pt);
.TP
\fB\-is\fR d, \fB\-\-intspaces\fR d
space between different pages (default 1pt);
.TP
\fB\-p\fR list, \fB\-\-pages\fR list
only consider sublist of pages of input document. List is a
comma-separated list of pages or ranges pages of the form a-b; a can
be omitted to start from first page, and b can be omitted to end at
the last page. Therefore, "\fB\-p\fR -" (which is the default)
includes all pages. Also allows modulo, so that "\fB\-p\fR 0%2" would
include only even-numbered pages.
.TP
\fB\-bb\fR list, \fB\-\-bb\fR list
only consider sublist of pages of input document for computing bounding box;
.TP
\fB\-nobb\fR list, \fB\-\-no-bb\fR list
omit list of pages of input document from computation of bounding box;
.TP
\fB\-g\fR, \fB\-\-get-bb\fR
only compute (and output) bounding box;
.TP
\fB\-s\fR x y W H, \fB\-\-set-bb\fR x y W H
set the bounding box to the given values;
.TP
\fB\-w\fR file, \fB\-\-watermark\fR file
use file as background watermark. file can be any format accepted by
pdflatex (e.g. png or pdf). If file is a multipage PDF file, page n of
the watermark file is used with page n of the input file, and the last
page of the watermark file is repeated if the input file has more pages;
.TP
\fB\-wp\fR p, \fB\-\-watermark-period\fR p
repeat the last p pages of the watermark file instead of only the last one;
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-debug\fR
debug mode: keep intermediary files;
.TP
\fB\-V [0-3]\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR [0-3]
select verbosity (default: 1);
.TP
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
run quietly (equiv. '-V=0');
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
print version number and exit;
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
print help message and exit.
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
\fB# pdfxup file.pdf\fR
produces 2-up pdf file from file.pdf
.TP
\fB# pdfxup -bb 1-4 file.pdf\fR
same behaviour, but computes the bounding box only using the 
first 4 pages (this saves time when processing long documents)
.TP
\fB# pdfxup -b -o booklet.pdf file.pdf\fR
same behaviour, but creates a booklet (as booklet.pdf)
.TP
\fB# pdfxup -kbb -x1 -y2 -l0 beamer-frames.pdf\fR
arranges 2 beamer frames per page (not reducing margins)
.TP
\fB# pdfxup -kbb -x2 -y2 -l beamer-frames.pdf:1-12,15-19\fR
arranges 4 beamer frames per page (not reducing margins), including
only frames 1 to 12 and 15 to 19.
