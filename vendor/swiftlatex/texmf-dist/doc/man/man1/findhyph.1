.SH "NAME"
findhyph – find words hyphenated by TeX in a document
.SH "INSTALLATION"
.IX Header "INSTALLATION"
Copy \fBfindhyph\fR or \fBfindhyph.bat\fR (depending on \s-1OS\s0 used) to a directory 
included in system \s-1PATH.\s0 Perl interpreter is required to be in 
\&\f(CW\*(C`/usr/bin/\*(C'\fR for Unix-like systems or in \s-1PATH\s0 when using \fBfindhyph.bat\fR.

To use this program:
.IP "1)" 4
.IX Item "1)"
set \f(CW\*(C`\etracingparagraphs=1\*(C'\fR in a TeX document \fIfoo.tex\fR and run:
.IP "2)" 4
.IX Item "2)"
\&\fBtex\fR \fIfoo.tex\fR
.IP "3)" 4
.IX Item "3)"
\&\fBfindhyph [options]\fR \fIfoo.log\fR
.PP
If you are setting \f(CW\*(C`\elooseness=<N>\*(C'\fR to optimize paragraphs, 
you need to pass that information to the file \fIfoo.log\fR in a form 
\&\f(CW\*(C`@looseness=<N>\*(C'\fR (on a separate line). You can use a macro like
\&\f(CW\*(C`\edef\esetlooseness#1{\elooseness=#1 \eimmediate\ewrite\-1{@looseness=#1}}\*(C'\fR
for this purpose. If the paragraph contains material in display math mode,
you need to use the macro in all split parts of the paragraph.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
.IP "\fB\-c\fR" 4
.IX Item "-c"
display hyphenated words in context
.IP "\fB\-f\fR" 4
.IX Item "-f"
display font selectors and other strings starting with a backslash character
.IP "\fB\-v\fR" 4
.IX Item "-v"

.IP "\fB\-p\fR" 4
.IX Item "-p"
generate file containing information about one-letter prepositions and 
conjunctions left at the end of line
.IP "\fB\-l=STRING\fR" 4
.IX Item "-l=STRING"
use prepositions/conjunctions listed in \s-1STRING\s0 instead of default list of 
prepositions and conjunctions \f(CW\*(C`kKsSvVzZoOuUiIA\*(C'\fR used for Slovak and Czech
language
.SH "OUTPUT FILES"
.IX Header "OUTPUT FILES"
.IP "\fIfoo.hyph\fR" 4
.IX Item "foo.hyph"
List of hyphenated words. All punctuation characters, parentheses and
other character immediately preceding or following displayed words are included
in this list. TeX constructs which are too difficult to display (\f(CW\*(C`\ehbox{}\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`\emark{}\*(C'\fR etc.) are shown as \f(CW\*(C`[]\*(C'\fR. Math mode is indicated by \f(CW\*(C`$\*(C'\fR sign.
.Sp
Page numbers in square brackets refer to \s-1LOG\s0 file and may occasionally differ
from the typeset document. The reason is that TeX may need to break more 
paragraphs than it would eventually fit on the page in order to find a page
break.
.Sp
Words hyphenated in footnotes are listed before the words hyphenated in the 
paragraph in which the footnote is referenced.
.IP "\fIfoo.prep\fR" 4
.IX Item "foo.prep"
List of prepositions if option \fB\-p\fR is used.
