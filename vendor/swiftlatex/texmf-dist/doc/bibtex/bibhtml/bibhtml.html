<p><em>Bibhtml</em> consists of a set of BibTeX style files, which
allow you to use BibTeX to produce bibliographies in HTML.  These are
modelled closely on the standard BibTeX style files.  For sample output,
see <a href="#refs">the reference section below</a>.</p>

<p>To accompany them, this package includes a pair of XSLT scripts
which illustrate how you might integrate these generated
bibliographies into an XML/HTML workflow.</p>

<p>The output of these style files is usable as-is, but it benefits
from some post-processing, to remove TeX-isms.  There’s a <em>sed</em>
script in the distribution which does exactly that, called
<code>detex.sed</code>.  If you want to make a version of that in some
other regexp-supporting language, let me know and I can include it in
the distribution.</p>

<p>As well,
the package includes a Perl script which orchestrates the various steps
required to manage such a bibliography for one or more HTML files.
The references in the text are linked directly to the corresponding
bibliography entry, and if a URL is defined in the entry within the
BibTeX database file, then the generated bibliography entry is linked
to this.</p>
    
<p>The BibTeX style files are
<code>abbrvhtml.bst</code>,
<code>alphahtml.bst</code>,
<code>plainhtml.bst</code> and
<code>unsrthtml.bst</code>.
As well, there are
<code>.bst</code> files which produce their output in date order.  To
use them, you should generate an <code>.aux</code> file by some
appropriate means, and include the line
<code>\bibstyle{plainhtml}</code>.  Run BibTeX, and the result is a
<code>.bbl</code> file, in broadly the same style as the corresponding
traditional BibTeX one, but formatted
using HTML rather than LaTeX.  This might form a useful component of a
XSLT-based workflow.  For further details, see the discussion of the
style files <a href="#bst-files">below</a>.</p>

<p>There is also a Perl script, <em>bibhtml</em>, which can orchestrate generating and using
this <code>.aux</code> file.  This script isn’t really maintained any
more, but it is still distributed, and documented <a href="#usage">below</a>.</p>

<p><em>Bibhtml</em> works with a standard BibTeX database – it is
intended to be compatible with a database used in the standard way
with LaTeX.  The <a href="#bst-files">BibTeX style files</a>
distributed with this package define an additional
<code>url</code> field: if this is present, then the generated entry
will contain a link to this URL.  They also define an
<code>eprint</code> field – if you do not use the LANL preprint
archive, this will be of no interest to you.</p>

<h2><a name="bst-files" id="bst-files">BibTeX style files</a></h2>

<p>The package includes several BibTeX style files.  As well as the
ones directly derived from the standard styles, there are also
<code>plainhtmldate.bst</code>,
<code>plainhtmldater.bst</code>,
<code>alphahtmldate.bst</code> and
<code>alphahtmldater.bst</code> styles,
which are derived from the standard
<code>plain.bst</code> and <code>alpha.bst</code> styles,
which sort the
output by date and reverse date, rather than by author.</p>

<p>In version 2 of the <em>bibhtml</em> package, the
<code>*html.bst</code> files are derived from the traditional files
using the <a href="http://purl.org/nxg/dist/urlbst">urlbst</a>
package, and then minimally adjusted so as to produce HTML rather than
LaTeX.</p>

<p>Since they are derived via the <em>urlbst</em> package, these style
files support an additional entry type, <code>@webpage</code>, and two
additional fields on all entry types, <code>url</code> and
<code>lastchecked</code>, which give the URL associated with the
reference, and the date at which the URL was last verified to be still
present.</p>

<p>The distributed <code>.bst</code> files have two configurable
parameters, which you might want to adjust for your installation:</p>

<p>The variable <code>'xxxmirror</code> gives the host name of the arXiv mirror which will be used
when generating links to eprints.  The default setting in the
<code>.bst</code> files is:</p>
<pre>
"xxx.arxiv.org" 'xxxmirror :=
</pre>

<p>By default, the style files generate link targets in the
bibliography with the same name as the citation key.  Thus a BibTeX
entry with key <code>surname99</code>, say, would appear in the
generated HTML <code>.bbl</code> file wrapped in <code>&lt;a
name="surname99"&gt;...&lt;/a&gt;</code>.  If this is inconvenient,
perhaps because it conflicts with other links within the file,
then you can adjust the <code>'hrefprefix</code> variable within the
style file, to specify a prefix which should appear in the link key.
Thus setting</p>
<pre>
"ref:" 'hrefprefix :=
</pre>
<p>in the <code>.bst</code> file would produce links like <code>&lt;a
name="ref:surname99"&gt;...&lt;/a&gt;</code> in the <code>.bbl</code>
file.</p>

<h2><a name="xslt" id="xslt">XSLT scripts</a></h2>

<p>The distribution includes a pair of sample XSLT scripts:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>bibhtml-extract-aux.xslt</code> shows how you might use XSLT to
extract citations from a source file into an <code>.aux</code>
file, for processing into a <code>.bbl</code> file;</li>
<li><code>bibhtml-insert-bib.xslt</code> shows how you might use XSLT
to insert the resulting <code>.bbl</code> file into the original
file.</li>
</ul>

<p>The scripts assume that a source file is in XHTML, and has
citations marked up as</p>
<pre>
&lt;span class='cite'&gt;ref99&lt;/span&gt;
</pre>
<p>and that the bibliography is indicated with</p>
<pre>
&lt;?bibliography <em>bibdata</em> <em>bibstyle</em>?&gt;
</pre>
<p>A suitable workflow, taking as an example the source file for the
page you are reading, is:</p>
<pre>
% xsltproc bibhtml-extract-aux.xslt bibhtml.html &gt;bibhtml.aux                    
% bibtex bibhtml
This is BibTeX, Version 0.99c (Web2C 7.5.7)
The top-level auxiliary file: bibhtml.aux
The style file: unsrthtml.bst
Database file #1: bibrefs.bib
% sed -f detex.sed bibhtml.bbl &gt;bibhtml.bbl.tmp
% mv bibhtml.bbl.tmp bibhtml.bbl
% xsltproc --stringparam bibfile-name bibhtml \
    bibhtml-insert-bib.xslt bibhtml.html &gt;bibhtml-new.html
</pre>

<p>The <code>bibhtml.xslt</code> script, when run over a source file,
generates a <code>.aux</code> suitable for processing with BibTeX.
The resulting <code>.bbl</code> file, possibly after
<a href="#postprocessing">post-processing</a>, can be included in the
source XHTML with an XSLT script which includes something like:</p>
<pre>
&lt;xsl:template select="processing-instruction('bibliography')"&gt;
  &lt;xsl:copy-of select="document('mybib.bbl')"/&gt;
&lt;/xsl:template&gt;
</pre>

<h2><a name="postprocess" id="postprocess">Postprocessing HTML bibliographies</a></h2>

<p>The output of the BibTeX styles is designed so that it is generally
reasonably usable without any post-processing.  However it is not
ideal, since there are occasionaly TeX-isms such as backslash-escaped
characters and the like, depending on what is in the source
<code>.bib</code> file.  Also, without post-processing any DOIs in
the source file aren’t formed into links.</p>

<p>The distribution includes a <code>sed</code> file,
<code>detex.sed</code>, which can do appropriate post-processing.
Thus the normal workflow is:</p>
<pre>
% bibtex mydoc
% sed -f detex.sed mydoc.bbl &gt;mydoc.bbl.tmp
% mv mydoc.bbl.tmp mydoc.bbl
</pre>
<p>Since it uses <code>sed</code>, this is fairly obviously
unix-specific, but if anyone would like to contribute a script with
similar functionality (it’s just a few moderately tortuous regular
expressions), I’d be delighted to include it in the distribution.</p>

<h2><a name="install" id="install">Installation</a></h2>

<p>The <code>.bst</code> files have to be installed 
<a href="http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=inst-wlcf">‘somewhere where LaTeX can find them’</a>.  If you give the command
<code>kpsepath bst</code> you can see the list of directories that
BibTeX searches for <code>.bst</code> files – on my system, I’d put
them into <code>/usr/local/texlive/texmf-local/bibtex/bst</code>,
which is a directory for system-wide local additions.</p>

<p>If you wish, you may change the distributed BibTeX style files (see 
<a href="#bst-files">above</a>) to the extent of changing the
‘eprint’ mirror site from the master <code>xxx.arxiv.org</code> to a
more local mirror.  If you don’t use the LANL preprint archive, this
will be of no interest to you.</p>

<h2><a name="usage" id="usage">The <em>bibhtml</em> script</a></h2>

<p>As noted above, <strong>this script should still work and is distributed on
that basis, but it’s no longer maintained, and won’t be further developed.</strong>
The XSLT-based mechanism described above is probably more robust;
also, the interface described in this section is not the same as the interface
of the <a href="#xslt">XSLT scripts</a> section above.</p>

<h3>The BibTeX database</h3>

<p>TeX features such as <code>~</code> and <code>--</code> are translated to
corresponding HTML entities (controlled with the <code>+3</code>
switch, see below), but other TeX constructions will make their way
into the generated HTML, and look a little odd.  I might try to deal
with these in future versions.  </p>

<h3>Preparing the text</h3>

<p>You prepare your text simply by including links to the bibliography file
(the default is <code>bibliography.html</code>), followed by a fragment
composed of the BibTeX citation key.  Thus, you might cite [grendel89]
with</p>
<pre>&lt;a href="bibliography.html#grendel89"&gt;(Grendel, 1989)&lt;/a&gt;</pre>
<p>(of course, the link text can be anything you like).  That’s all there is to
it.  When you run <em>bibhtml</em>, it generates an
<code>.aux</code> file which makes BibTeX produce references for exactly those
keys which appear in this way. </p>

<h3><a name="pis" id="pis">Preparing the bibliography file – processing
instructions supported</a></h3>

<p>The bibliography file is an ordinary HTML document (which may
itself have citations within it), distinguished only by having two
processing instructions within it.
<em>Bibhtml</em> replaces everything between
<code>&lt;?bibhtml start ?&gt;</code>
and
<code>&lt;?bibhtml end ?&gt;</code> 
(which should be on lines by themselves) with the formatted
bibliography. It leaves those instructions in place, naturally, so once
this file is set up, you shouldn’t have to touch it again.  Older
versions of bibhtml used the magic comments <code>&lt;-- bibhtml start
--&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;-- bibhtml end --&gt;</code>: these are
still supported, but are deprecated and may disappear in a future version.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you may include the processing instruction
<code>&lt;?bibhtml insert?&gt;</code>.  This acts broadly like the
<code>start</code> and <code>end</code> processing instructions,
except that the line is completely replaced by the inserted
bibliography.  This is useful if the file being processed is a
generated file (perhaps the output of a separate XML tool-chain, for
example), which will not therefore have to be rescanned in future.</p>

<p>You can specify the bibliography database and style file either on
the command line (see <a href="#options">below</a>) or using the
<code>&lt;?bibhtml bibdata </code><em>bibfile</em><code>?&gt;</code>
and <code>&lt;?bibhtml bibstyle</code><em>stylefile</em><code>?&gt;</code> instructions.  The
value of ‘bibdata’ is cumulative, and appends to any value specified
on the command line.  A value of ‘bibstyle’ specified on the command
line, in contrast, overrides any value in the file.</p>

<p>As a special case, <em>bibhtml</em> also replaces the line <em>after</em> a
comment <code>&lt;?bibhtml today ?&gt;</code> with today’s date.</p>

<p>Summary of processing instructions:</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>&lt;?bibhtml start?&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;?bibhtml
stop?&gt;</code></dt>
<dd>Bracket the bibliography – any text between these PIs is replaced
when <em>bibhtml</em> is next run.</dd>

<dt><code>&lt;?bibhtml insert?&gt;</code></dt>
<dd>This PI is replaced by the bibliography when <em>bibhtml</em> is
next run.  This PI is always removed, irrespective of the presence or
absence of the <code>--strip</code> option.</dd>

<dt><code>&lt;?bibhtml bibdata </code><em>bibfile</em><code>?&gt;</code></dt>
<dd>Specify the bibliography database to be used.  This is the
analogue of a
<code>\bibliography{</code><em>bibfile</em><code>}</code> command in a
LaTeX file; see also the <code>-b</code> command-line option.</dd>

<dt><code>&lt;?bibhtml bibstyle </code><em>stylefile</em><code>?&gt;</code></dt>
<dd>Specify the bibliography style to be used.  This is the analogue
of <code>\bibliographystyle{</code><em>stylefile</em><code>}</code>
command in a LaTex file; see also the <code>-s</code> command-line option.</dd>

<dt><code>&lt;?bibhtml today?&gt;</code></dt>
<dd>Replace the <em>following</em> line by today’s date.</dd>
</dl>

<h3><a name="options" id="options">Supported options</a></h3>

<p><em>Usage</em></p>
<pre>
% bibhtml [options...] filename...
% bibhtml --merge file.bbl file.html
</pre>

<p>The <code>filename</code> argument is the name of a file to be scanned.</p>

<p><em>Bibhtml</em> takes a list of HTML files as argument (though see
<a href="#two-pass">below</a> for a two-pass variant).  It creates an
<code>.aux</code> file, runs BibTeX, and merges the resulting
<code>.bbl</code> file (if it exists) into <code>bibliography.html</code>, or
whatever has been specified as the bibliography file name. </p>

<p>There are several options:</p>
<dl>
<dt>-3, +3</dt>
<dd>Set this to +3 if you want <code>~</code> translated to
<code>&amp;nbsp;</code>, and <code>--</code> to
<code>&amp;enspace;</code>. Or set it to -3 (the default) if you
don’t.</dd>

<dt>-a</dt>
<dd>If this option is set, <em>bibhtml</em> won’t bother scanning any
files at all, and will generate references for all the entries in your
database.  This is equivalent to <code>\nocite{*}</code> in LaTeX.</dd>

<dt>-b bibdata</dt>
<dd>The name of your BibTeX database file, as it would be specified in a
<code>\bibliography{}</code> command in LaTeX.  Unless <em>you</em> happen to
keep all your references in a file called <code>bib.bib</code>, you’ll
probably want to change this.  Or you can use the <code>&lt;?bibhtml
bibdata xxx?&gt;</code> <a href="#pis">processing instruction</a>.</dd>

<dt>-c configfile</dt>
<dd>Specifies a configuration file which contains a single line of
options, which are inserted in the command line at that point.</dd>

<dt><a name="merge" id="merge">--merge</a></dt>
<dd>In this special case, <em>bibhtml</em> takes two arguments, a
<code>.bbl</code> file and an <code>.html</code> file, 
merges the first into the second, and nothing else.  It’s
intended to be used when you have generated a
<code>.bbl</code> file by a separate run of BibTeX, and simply
wish to merge the results into your bibliography file.  As
such, it will most likely be useful as part of a script, or
other post-processing system.</dd>

<dt>-r rootname</dt>
<dd>Specify this and you’ll create <code>rootname.html</code>,
<code>rootname.aux</code> and so on.  Why not just stick with the default
‘bibliography’...? </dd>

<dt><a name="opt-s" id="opt-s">-s bibstyle</a></dt>
<dd>The name of the BibTeX bibliography style you want to use, as it
would be specified for the <code>\bibstyle</code> command in
LaTeX.  If you want to have a different layout for your HTML
bibliographies, please don’t change the file plainhtml.bst
distributed with bibhtml.  Instead, make a <em>copy</em> of
plainhtml.bst under a different name, edit it as much as you
like, and use this option of bibhtml to use the modified
version instead of the default.  Or you can use the <code>&lt;?bibhtml
bibstyle xxx?&gt;</code> <a href="#pis">processing instruction</a>.</dd>

<dt><a name="strip" id="strip">--strip</a></dt>
<dd>If this option is set, then strip all processing-instruction lines
from the output file.  This means that the resulting file cannot be
processed again by <em>bibhtml</em>, and so is appropriate when the
file is the output of a separate tool-chain.</dd>

<dt>-V, --version</dt>
<dd>Bibhtml prints the version information and exits.</dd>

<dt>-v, -q</dt>
<dd>Do you want the program to be verbose or quiet? The default is -v,
verbose.</dd>

</dl> 

<p>The defaults for the various parameters are unlikely to be helpful,
so you’re likely to want to set one or more of them every time you run
the program. It is for this reason, and because you’re likely to want
the same set of options every time you create the bibliography for a
set of files in a directory, that you can put a collection of options
in a configuration file.  This can be specified on the command line
with the option <code>-c configfilename</code>.  If this option
is not given, then <em>bibhtml</em> looks for a file named
<code>bibhtml.config</code>.  For example, the configuration
file  might contain:</p>

<pre>
-b mybib +3 -r refs
</pre>

<h3><a name="two-pass" id="two-pass">Two-pass bibhtml</a></h3>

<p>You might sometimes have a need to invoke the
two phases separately.  If you make a symbolic link to the program via
<code>ln -s bibhtml bibhtml2</code>, then you can generate an
aux-file alone by giving the command <code>bibhtml2 *.html</code>,
say; and you can merge a bbl-file into the bibliography file with the
command <code>bibhtml2 bibliography.bbl</code>.  The command line option
<code>--merge</code> <a href="#merge">above</a> may be more suitable
if you are calling this code from a script, as it requires you to
specify both the <code>.bbl</code> and the <code>.html</code> file it
is being merged with, (and so it is more robust, and more flexible).</p>

<p>On Unix, this works because the program is able to
detect the name it was invoked under.  This may be more difficult on other
platforms.  If so, please get in touch, with suggestions. </p>
