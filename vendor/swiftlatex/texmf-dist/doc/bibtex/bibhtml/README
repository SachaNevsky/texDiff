Bibhtml consists of a set of BibTeX style files, which allow you to
use BibTeX to produce bibliographies in HTML.  These are modelled
closely on the standard BibTeX style files, paired so that
plainhtml.bst is derived from plain.bst.

To accompany them, this package includes a pair of XSLT scripts which
illustrate how you might integrate these generated bibliographies into
an XML/HTML workflow.

The long-term URL for this package is http://purl.org/nxg/dist/bibhtml

The code is available at <https://bitbucket.org/nxg/bibhtml>,
where you can find an issues list.

This distribution contains bibhtml version 2.0.2, released 2013 September 8.
