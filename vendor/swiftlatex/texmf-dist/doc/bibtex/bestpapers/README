Many people preparing their resumes find the requirement ``please list
five (or six, or ten) papers authored by you''.  The same requirement
is often stated for reports prepared by professional teams.  The
creation of such lists may be a cumbersome task. Even more difficult
is to support the lists over the time, when one adds new papers.  The
style bestpapers.bst is intended to make this task simpler.  It is
based on the idea that it is easier to score than to sort: we can
assign a score to a paper, and then let the computer to select the
papers with highest scores.
