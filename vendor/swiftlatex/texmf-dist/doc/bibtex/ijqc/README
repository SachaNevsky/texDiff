Wiley's International Journal of Quantum Chemistry. It is not in any way
officially endorsed by the publisher or editors, and provided without
any warranty one could ever think of.

Source Files:

README    - this file here
ijqc.bst  - the main style file. To be copied into a directory where
            BSTINPUTS will find it. This is the only file that is worth
            saving.
mybib.bib - the BibTeX database used in xampl.tex. Some entries are
            willfully crumpled to expose how bibtex reacts to this; see
            xampl.blg.
xampl.tex - the LaTeX source code that demonstrates the references rendered
            by ijqc.bst

            bibtex and pdflatex over xampl.tex
