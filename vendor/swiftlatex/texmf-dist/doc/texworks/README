Public domain.  Originally written by Karl Berry, 2009.

TeXworks is a cross-platform GUI front end for TeX, written by Jonathan Kew.
Its home page is http://tug.org/texworks, with links to documentation,
articles, and othe resources.

TeX Live includes a Windows binary for TeXworks, and MacTeX includes a
MacOSX binary.  No other binaries are included, because it depends
(implicitly or explicitly) on so many libraries that it is impossible to
ship anything that has a chance of working across different releases.

So for other platforms, please download from the TeXworks home page if
available, or compile from source.
