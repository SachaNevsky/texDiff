This tree (texmf-dist) contains the packages and their documentation and
support files which are distributed by TeX Live.

The binaries and TL infrastructure files themselves are in separate
directories (bin/ and tlpkg/ respectively), but just about everything
else we distribute is here.  Files generated during installation or use
are in separate texmf-config and texmf-var.

TeX Live started with just one tree (named texmf); over time, it was
split into other trees (texmf-dist, texmf-doc) for reasons that seemed
good at the time, but as of TeX Live 2013, it seemed simplest to once
again have only one main tree.  We kept the name texmf-dist instead of
going back to texmf since the "-dist" explicitly signals that it is the
files that are distributed.
