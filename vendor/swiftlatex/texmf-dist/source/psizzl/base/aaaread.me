                   PSIZZL - A TeX Format for Physics Papers


      PSIZZL is a TeX format for physics papers written at SLAC and used at
seveal other places. It uses too many fonts to work with the version of TeX on
the VAX Cluster, so the sans serif and small caps fonts have been removed, and
the control sequences for these have been redefined to give Roman type. Both
the modified source code and a .FMT file are contained in this directory. 

      Please report any problems to F. Paige at X3836.
