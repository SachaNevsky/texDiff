Notes on generating or revising the support files for DDSerif, 05/01/2018

1. The basic font files are DSSerif.pfb, DSSerif-Bold.pfb, DSSerifUni.pfb, DSSerifUni-Bold.pfb, along with the corresponding afm files.

2. The *Uni* files have only bare bones support, generated by

afm2tfm DSSerifUni
afm2tfm DSSerifUni-Bold

The generated tfm files contain no ligkern information, as these files are supposed to be used only in the construction of virtual fonts, the last stage of whose contruction will add the ligkern data.

3. To regenerate the remaining support files with your modifications, follow the following steps.

3a: Copy all files in the package source to a working directory, along with the two non "Uni" afm files.

3b: Modify adjustments.mtx to specify new kerns that affect the positions of math accents.

3c: Process the driver file:

tex DSSerif-drv
vptovf DSSerif
vptovf DSSerif-Bold

3d: Discard DSSerif.vf, DSSerif-Bold.vf and udsserif.fd. 
You should not need to change the contents of DSSeif.map. 

3e: Move DSSerif.tfm and DSSerif-Bold.tfm into your tex heirarchy in a position that has priority over their position in the distribution.
