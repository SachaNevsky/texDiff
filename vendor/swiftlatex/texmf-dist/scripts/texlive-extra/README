(This file is public domain.)

This directory contains scripts maintained as part of TeX Live. Unlike
everything else under Master/texmf-dist/scripts, except scripts/texlive,
these scripts are actually maintained here, and not under Build.

These scripts are not important for the infrastructure or installation
of TeX Live. They just happen to be maintained by us; many were
inherited from teTeX.

See texmf-dist/scripts/texlive/README (i.e., ../texlive/README) for more
info.

The principal mailing list is http://lists.tug.org/tex-live.

All of these scripts are free software, mostly public domain.
